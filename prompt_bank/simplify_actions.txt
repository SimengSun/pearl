You are given a list of functions as well as their corresponding explanations. Please reduce the list by merging the functions that have the same or similar functionalities, abstract over-specific functions with unified functions. Please reduce the list by at least half.

For instance, "FIND_IMPLICATION(CTX, X)" "FIND_IMPLICATIONS(CTX, X)" can be merged to a single one function as they are essentially the same. 

For another instance, "FIND_NOT_DESCRIBE(CTX, X)" is redundant because you can always use "FIND_DESCRIPTIONS(CTX, X)" and then infer the "NOT_DESCRIBE" from the descriptions returned by "FIND_DESCRIPTIONS(CTX, X)". In general, any function that contains "NOT" in the function name can be removed if there is a corresponding function that can be negated.

"FIND_RELATION(CTX, X, Y)" and "FIND_RELATIONSHIP(CTX, X, Y)" and "COMPARE_RELATIONSHIP(CTX, X, Y)" can all be merged to one function.

Given the above examples, please reduce the following list to at most one third of its current length. Please also include the definition of each function.
