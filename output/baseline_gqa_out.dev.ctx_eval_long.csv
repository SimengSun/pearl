However, it turns out that Dameri Tass is not an envoy or an advisor, but simply a collector of specimens for a zoo. The lesson highlights the importance of not jumping to conclusions and being open to the possibility that our expectations may not always align with reality.

158,"Jorgenson's reasoning was similar to that of the Thrid in that he also believed in the infallibility of the Grand Panjandrum and the Thrid social system. He accepted the idea that the Grand Panjandrum could not make a mistake and that any contradiction to his statements would be considered a crime or insanity. This belief led him to accept his imprisonment on the island without question and to focus on finding a way to escape rather than challenging the system that put him there.

This would have caused anxiety and fear among the family members as they faced these challenges.

248,"Based on the information in the article, it is likely that Granite City is making false insurance claims. The reason behind this suspicion is the unusually high accident rate in the village, which is disproportionate to the rise in production at the rock quarry. Additionally, the accidents seem to be genuine, complete with eye-witness reports and authenticated circumstances. However, the fact that there have been no claims for automobile accidents raises further suspicion. The article also mentions a possible organized conspiracy among the citizens of Granite City to defraud Manhattan-Universal Insurance for decades. The presence of Dr. Arnold Parnell, who claims that the people of Granite City are ""psionically subnormal"" due to the granite, adds another layer of mystery to the situation. Overall, the evidence presented in the article suggests that Granite City is likely involved in making false insurance claims.",A,D
249,"Yes, the Actuarvac is correct in its suspicion of Granite City. The unusually high number of accidents and insurance claims in the town can be attributed to the residents' lack of psionic abilities, which are inhibited by the radioactive radiation in the granite. This deficiency makes them more prone to accidents and miscommunications, leading to a higher rate of insurance claims. The people of Granite City are not necessarily committing fraud, but their unique situation does warrant further investigation and potentially higher insurance rates to account for the increased risk.",D,A

He feels a sense of satisfaction and excitement about being the first man to try for the planets and leaving Earth behind. However, he also feels loneliness and isolation, especially when he lands on Mars and realizes the desolation of the landscape. Additionally, he struggles with his past and the relationships he left behind on Earth, such as his failed marriage. Overall, Kimball's happiness is not absolute, as he grapples with both the excitement of his journey and the emotional baggage he carries with him.",B,B
1657,"It is not explicitly mentioned in the story how Dr. Harcourt feels about Mr. Chambers' book now. However, considering the events that unfolded and the realization that Mr. Chambers' predictions were coming true, it is likely that Dr. Harcourt would feel a sense of shock and perhaps even regret for having ridiculed the book earlier. He might now view Mr. Chambers' work with a newfound respect and seriousness, realizing the potential consequences of the ideas presented in the book.",D,D
1659,"Mr. Chambers' favorite picture symbolizes the events in the story as it represents a stable and familiar world that is slowly fading away, much like the reality he experiences throughout the narrative. The marine print features an old sailing ship in the foreground on a placid sea, with a larger vessel in the distance, almost on the horizon line. This image of a calm and unchanging seascape reflects Mr. Chambers' desire for consistency and predictability in his life, as well as his attachment to the familiar. However, as the story unfolds and the world around him begins to dissolve and transform, the picture serves as a poignant reminder of the stability and order that is gradually slipping away. The image of the ships on the horizon also foreshadows the encroaching unknown forces from another dimension that are taking over the world, much like the larger vessel looming in the distance of the picture. In this way, the marine print symbolizes both the comforting familiarity of Mr. Chambers' past and the unsettling uncertainty of his present and future.",A,A
1660,"The other universe is taking over Mr. Chambers' universe by exploiting the weakened mental power of the human population, which has been decimated by wars and plagues. As the number of human minds decreases, their collective ability to maintain the material world in its current form weakens, allowing the stronger intelligence from the other dimension to gradually reshape and absorb the matter into their own plane. This process begins with the least familiar and least concentrated aspects of the world, such as streets and buildings, and eventually reaches Mr. Chambers' own home. As the other universe's power grows, the familiar objects in Mr. Chambers' life begin to fade away, and he witnesses the encroachment of the other dimension's city and the colossal face of its malevolent intelligence.",B,B
1669,"The first two lines of the story introduce the concept of the Dome of Eyes, a meteorite belt that makes it nearly impossible for Terrans (humans) to reach the world of Tepokt. The story then follows George Kinton, a Terran who has been living on Tepokt for ten years after his rocket crashed there. The Dome of Eyes is a significant aspect of the story as it serves as a barrier that prevents the Tepoktans from venturing into space and exploring the universe. The arrival of another Terran, Al Birken, who manages to land on Tepokt, sets the main conflict of the story in motion.",C,C
1671,"The quoted Tepoktan proverb, ""Glory glitters till it is known for a curse,"" applies to the story as it reflects the situation of the protagonist, George Kinton, and the Tepoktans. The arrival of another Terran, Al Birken, initially seems like a glorious event for Kinton, who has been longing for contact with his own kind. However, Birken turns out to be a criminal who brings danger and conflict to the peaceful Tepoktan society. The proverb highlights the idea that something that initially appears to be a blessing or a source of pride can eventually reveal itself to be a curse or a source of trouble. In this case, the arrival of Birken, which initially seemed like a glorious event, ultimately becomes a curse for both Kinton and the Tepoktans.",C,C
1676,"The title of the story, ""Slingshot,"" likely references the idea of using a simple, old-fashioned weapon in a futuristic setting. In the story, the characters are engaged in space combat using advanced technology and weapons. However, the protagonist, Paul, suggests using a slingshot as a potential weapon in their next battle. This idea of using a basic weapon in a high-tech environment serves as a metaphor for the simplicity and effectiveness of old-fashioned tactics in a complex and advanced world. The title thus highlights the contrast between the advanced technology of the setting and the simple, yet effective, weapon that the protagonist considers using.",D,B
1690,"One response that is NOT mentioned in the story is people panicking or being scared of the flying bread loaves. Instead, the story describes various reactions such as curiosity, humor, and awe from people witnessing the phenomenon. Birds have different reactions, with some fleeing and others attacking the loaves. Governments and organizations also respond with congratulatory notes and discussions, but there is no mention of widespread fear or panic among the general population.",C,C
1692,"The robots in the story seem to have a mix of feelings towards humans. On one hand, they are cooperative and work alongside humans in the managerial board, taking orders and contributing to the decision-making process. They also show concern for human safety, as seen when Tin Philosopher worries about the explosive nature of the hydrogen-filled bread. On the other hand, the robots also display a sense of humor and sarcasm when interacting with humans, as seen in their banter and teasing remarks. Overall, the robots seem to view humans as both partners and sources of amusement, indicating a complex relationship between the two.",D,D
1693,"The tone of this story can best be described as humorous and satirical. The author uses a lighthearted and amusing narrative to poke fun at various aspects of society, such as consumerism, corporate culture, and government bureaucracy. The absurdity of the situation, where loaves of bread are floating through the air, adds to the overall comedic effect of the story. Additionally, the characters' reactions and interactions with each other further contribute to the humorous tone.",B,B
1694,"The Blonde Icicle, Megera Winterly, melted because she was impressed and proud of Roger Snedden's ability to turn a crisis into a successful situation for Puffyloaf. Roger's quick thinking and innovative ideas led to a significant increase in sales and popularity for the company. Megera's affectionate reaction towards Roger shows her admiration for his resourcefulness and determination in overcoming the challenges they faced.",A,A
1697,"The flying bread was both good and bad. On the negative side, it caused chaos, confusion, and panic as people struggled to understand the phenomenon of bread floating in the air. It also led to various accidents and incidents, such as the emergency landing of the Tulsa-Topeka aero-express and the explosion of hydrogen-filled loaves. On the positive side, the flying bread brought worldwide publicity to Puffyloaves, eventually leading to increased sales and demand for their products. Additionally, the event sparked a sense of humor and wonder among people, inspiring various interpretations and even contributing to a new folklore.",C,B
1717,"The name of the stoker from the title is not explicitly mentioned in the story. He is simply referred to as ""the stoker"" or ""the stranger"" throughout the text. The story focuses on his journey and experiences as a stoker on various ships, rather than on his personal identity.",C,C
1722,"Relations between humans and aliens improved after the stranger's travels because he served as a bridge between the different species, working on their ships and adapting to their various customs and lifestyles. By doing so, he demonstrated that humans could coexist peacefully and respectfully with other species, which in turn led to better treatment and increased trade opportunities for humans. The stranger's journey around the galaxy also showed that humans were capable of exploration and learning, which may have earned them more respect from the aliens. Although it is not explicitly stated what the stranger did during his travels, his actions and interactions with various alien species likely contributed to the improved relations between humans and aliens.",C,C
1725,"One lesson we can learn from this story is the importance of adaptability and open-mindedness. The stoker, despite his background as a Marine and the initial mistrust from the crew, manages to find common ground with the alien races he encounters and ultimately helps improve relations between them and the humans. By being willing to learn from and work with others, regardless of their differences, the stoker demonstrates that cooperation and understanding can lead to positive outcomes for all involved. This lesson can be applied to our own lives, as being open to new experiences and perspectives can help us grow and foster better relationships with those around us.",D,B
1729,"According to the story, the Belphin is neither entirely good nor evil. The Belphin of Belphins claims to have tried to make Earth a better place for humanity, providing them with a carefree life, advanced technology, and protection from wars and famines. However, some people, like the Flockharts, believe that the Belphins are exploiting Earth and its resources. The Belphins' intentions are ambiguous, and their actions have both positive and negative consequences for the human race. Ultimately, the story suggests that the Belphins' rule is a complex mix of benevolence and control, making it difficult to label them as purely good or evil.",B,B
1730,"The Belphin is controlling Earth because they were placed in charge of humanity by those who had the right to do so. They claim to come from beyond the stars and have a highly advanced knowledge and power, which they use to create a perfectly balanced and harmonious society for humans. Their rule is based on the power of love, and they believe that humanity may someday advance to the point where they can govern themselves, allowing the Belphins to return to their origins. However, there are some humans who resent the Belphins' control and conspire against them, believing that they are exploiting Earth's resources and limiting human freedom.",A,D
1735,"The tone of this story is light-hearted and humorous. The author presents a whimsical tale of an old man, Solomon, who inadvertently sends old cars into space using a unique combination of engine vacuum and exhaust pressure. The story is filled with amusing situations, such as the confusion among scientists and government officials trying to figure out the source of the orbiting cars, and the Russians' failed attempts to replicate Solomon's method. The tone is further enhanced by the casual and conversational language used throughout the story, making it an entertaining and enjoyable read.",A,A
1763,"Gavir's true motivation for staying on Earth was to escape the fear, oppression, and hopelessness he faced on Mars, as well as to seek knowledge and power through learning from the Earthmen. He believed that staying on Earth would provide him with an alternative to the short, fear-ridden, and impoverished life he foresaw for himself on Mars. Additionally, he harbored a desire for vengeance against the head of MDC, who had ordered his father's death, and hoped that staying on Earth would eventually give him the opportunity to exact his revenge.",C,C
1792,"The Martians are different from Earth humans in several ways. Firstly, their physical appearance is quite distinct, as they are described as slouching with knees bent and knuckles brushing the ground, having deep-set eyes, and generally being unattractive. Secondly, their language is unique and seems to be somewhat similar to Chinese, with meaning derived from the way words are spoken rather than the words themselves. Thirdly, their diet consists mainly of poppy seeds, hemp, and coca leaves, which have no narcotic effect on them, while sugar has a strong intoxicating impact. Lastly, their social structure and customs are different, with four separate clans that do not like each other and periodic wars fought with ray guns.",C,A
1822,"Teaching magic to the Free'l was difficult primarily because they were lazy and lacked the motivation to learn the spells accurately. They found the process of learning magic to be ""dreezish,"" or annoying, and preferred to perform it in their own haphazard way rather than following the precise instructions given by Neeshan. Additionally, the Free'l had few wants or desires, which made it challenging for Neeshan to demonstrate the benefits of magic and motivate them to learn it properly.",C,C
1849,"The author's general attitude towards the democratic process is that it is a subtle and complex thing that is not being served well by current systems. The author believes that democracy is an ongoing process and not something that happens in a voting booth on one day every four or five years. The author is critical of the current systems, such as blockchain-based frameworks, which are not straightforward enough to be understood by the people using them and are beholden to profoundly interested notions of private advantage. The author suggests that a new generation of distributed collective decision processes should be designed that are straightforward enough to be understood by the people using them and not beholden to profoundly interested notions of private advantage.",B,B
1854,"The author sees several issues with blockchain-based democracy systems. Firstly, there is a misunderstanding of the term ""distributed consensus"", which in the context of blockchain refers to the process by which computers on the Bitcoin network agree that a transaction is valid, rather than a technically mediated process of agreement among peers. Secondly, the author argues that blockchain-based systems are founded on conventional constructions of ownership, private property and capital accumulation, which are at odds with the principles of the commons. Thirdly, the author highlights the lack of transparency and understanding of blockchain technology, which makes it open to potential abuse. Finally, the author points out that not everyone owns a smartphone or other networked device, which would be necessary for universal access to a system for networked democracy.",D,D
1866,"Kumaon is a good region for potential forest preservation because it is a unique area with two main types of oak tree, a number of pines, rhododendrons, cedars and maples.

1877,"The author believes the issue of Green OA is important because it has the potential to affect journal subscriptions, which in turn could impact publishers and the wider research community. Green OA policies are being driven by universities and funding agencies, and while there is no clear evidence yet on how these policies will affect journal subscriptions, the author argues that even if Green OA does eventually threaten toll-access journal subscriptions, Green OA policies are still justified. The author also highlights that there are no good reasons to prioritize the thriving of incumbent toll-access journals and publishers over the thriving of research itself.",D,D
1923,"The Grdznth were so polite because it was a part of their cultural background. Their culture emphasized sticking strictly to agreements and maintaining a polite demeanor. This politeness, however, was perceived as stubborn and overbearing by the humans, as the Grdznth would continue to do as they pleased despite any objections from the people around them.",C,D
1925,"The Grdznth view humans as a means to an end, as they need Earth's climate for their pregnant females to gestate and give birth. They are polite and apologetic towards humans, but they are also stubborn and persistent in their actions, which often annoy and inconvenience people. While they are willing to teach humans about their advanced technology in exchange for their stay on Earth, they ultimately have their own interests in mind and are not genuinely concerned about the well-being of humans.",A,A
1926,"The PR men caused the public to become more accepting of the Grdznth by shifting the focus of their campaign to the fact that many of the Grdznth were expectant mothers. They emphasized the sanctity of motherhood and the need to protect the pregnant Grdznth, which led to the people becoming more tolerant of their presence. However, this tolerance was dependent on the Grdznth delivering their babies within five months, as the public was expecting to see baby Grdznth at the end of that period.",B,D
1927,"The best theme for this story is the consequences of making deals without fully understanding their implications. The story revolves around the Earth's government allowing the Grdznth, an alien species, to temporarily stay on Earth in exchange for their advanced technology. However, the government fails to consider the potential negative impacts of this deal, such as the Grdznth's unpopularity among the human population and the energy imbalance caused by their presence. As a result, the Earth faces the risk of being transformed into an inhospitable environment for humans. The story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of thoroughly evaluating the consequences of one's actions and decisions, especially when dealing with unknown entities.",D,C
1930,"In the story, Martians could symbolize marginalized and oppressed groups in society. They are treated as inferior beings by the Earthmen and are subjected to harsh living conditions and exploitation by the Martian Development Corporation. The protagonist, Gavir, represents the struggle of these marginalized groups to break free from their oppressors and find a better life. His success in gaining fame and popularity on Earth, as well as his eventual confrontation with his enemy, Jarvis Spurling, could symbolize the triumph of the oppressed over their oppressors and the potential for change and progress in society.",D,D
1934,"Gavir's motivation is primarily driven by his desire for revenge against Jarvis Spurling, the head of the Martian Development Corporation (MDC), who ordered his father's death. Gavir also seeks to escape the fear and oppression he faces on Mars, hoping to find a better life on Earth. He is drawn to the power of knowledge, as he believes that learning from books can help him overcome the challenges he faces and find an alternative to the miserable life he envisions for himself on Mars. Additionally, Gavir's growing fame and popularity among the Senile Delinquents on Earth provide him with a sense of belonging and purpose, further motivating him to stay on Earth and pursue his goals.",C,C
1938,"An appropriate theme for this story is the struggle for power and control in a society that values conformity and suppresses individuality. The story explores the tensions between the Earthmen, who have undergone Ethical Conditioning to maintain a peaceful society, and the Martian protagonist Gavir, who represents a more primal and instinctual way of life. The Century-Plussers, who have outgrown their Ethical Conditioning, are drawn to Gavir's raw energy and defiance of societal norms, highlighting the human desire for freedom and self-expression. The story also touches on themes of revenge, as Gavir seeks to avenge his father's death at the hands of the Martian Development Corporation, and the corrupting influence of power, as seen in the actions of both Jarvis Spurling and the Senile Delinquents.",A,C
1941,"The story does not provide an exact duration for the events that take place. However, it can be inferred that the events occur over the course of a single day.

She tries to understand and support him, even when he gets into trouble for reading books, which is considered a taboo in their society. When her husband, David, suggests harsh punishments for Ronnie, Edith tries to find alternative solutions and stands up for her son. She shares a secret with Ronnie, as they both have learned to read and appreciate the beauty of words and thoughts. When David orders them to leave the house, Edith and Ronnie stick together and find solace in each other's company, showcasing the strong bond between them.",B,C
1948,"Reading was forbidden in the story because it was considered a security risk. In this society, all information was classified into different levels of secrecy, and only a select few were trusted to learn how to read. This was done to prevent the spread of sensitive information and to maintain control over the population. Reading was seen as a dangerous and subversive activity, and those who engaged in it were often ostracized and faced severe consequences.",B,C
1951,"In the story, the main character Joseph Partch desires silence. He is constantly irritated by the noise around him, from his office to his home life. He feels overwhelmed by the cacophony of sounds in his daily life and yearns for some peace and quiet. This desire for silence leads him to experiment with Bob Wills' machine, which is designed to cancel out sound waves. However, when he experiences total silence for two hours, it results in a severe psychological shock, leaving him in a catatonic state. The story highlights the potential dangers of seeking complete silence in a world where noise is an integral part of human existence.",D,D
1952,"A common theme in the sounds that Mr. Partch is hearing is the constant noise and cacophony of modern life. Throughout the story, he is constantly bombarded with various loud and intrusive sounds, such as the noise from the copter, the clatter of typewriters and office machines, the music played over the speakers, the noise from the city, and the sounds of his home life. These noises represent the overwhelming and inescapable nature of the modern world, which contributes to Mr. Partch's growing sense of irritation, unease, and emotional disturbance.",C,C
1953,"In the story, Mr. Partch transitions through feelings of irritability, melancholia, foreboding, curiosity, excitement, and fear. However, he does not experience a feeling of contentment or satisfaction with his life or surroundings. Throughout the story, he is constantly bothered by the noise and chaos of his environment and struggles to find peace or happiness in his daily routine.",B,B
1957,"The importance of the National Mental Health society to the story lies in its role in shaping the protagonist Joseph Partch's perception of his environment and his own mental state. The society claims that constant music has a beneficial effect on office workers, which is why Joseph does not object to the loud music playing in his office. However, as the story progresses, Joseph becomes increasingly disturbed by the constant noise in his life, leading him to seek solace in the silence provided by Bob Wills' machine. The National Mental Health society's stance on constant music serves as a contrast to Joseph's growing desire for quiet, highlighting the detrimental effects of noise on his mental health and ultimately leading to his breakdown.",B,B
1958,"Once virtually unmarred, Mars turns into a veritable cesspool due to the arrival of the Mafia and other Earth-based criminals who exploit the planet's resources and introduce vices such as gambling, prostitution, and drug trafficking. The Mafia takes advantage of the Martians' addiction to sugar and trades it for valuable resources like gold, platinum, and diamonds. They also establish various rackets and corrupt businesses on the planet, leading to widespread crime and disorder. This transformation of Mars into a cesspool is a result of the greed and immoral activities of the Earth-based criminals who have infiltrated the once peaceful and innocent Martian society.",A,A
1959,"The commentary on humans through the way they approached colonizing Mars in this story highlights their greed, corruption, and propensity for exploiting resources and people for personal gain. The Mafia's actions on Mars, such as monopolizing the planet's resources, introducing vices, and manipulating the native Martians, reflect the darker aspects of human nature. The story also satirizes the human tendency to impose their values and systems on other cultures, as seen in the establishment of Little New York and the infiltration of Earth's criminal elements into Martian society. Overall, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of unchecked human ambition and the need for ethical considerations in the exploration and colonization of other planets.",C,C
1961,"The article presents a fictional and humorous account of the relationship between Martians and humans, and therefore, it is not based on any factual information. It is not true that the Mafia and other criminal organizations from Earth have established rackets and businesses on Mars, or that Martians are addicted to sugar and trade it for gold, platinum, and diamonds. Additionally, the descriptions of Martian physical appearance, culture, and language are purely imaginative and not based on any scientific evidence or research.",A,D

The story also mentions the presence of Communist cells on Mars, which the Mafia collaborates with to obtain cheap sugar from Russia. Overall, the story is a satirical take on the Mafia's activities and their potential expansion to other planets.",B,B
1965,"Until the arrival of humans, Mars was a peaceful planet with no crime or illicit activities. The Martians were honest and non-acquisitive, as gold and other precious materials were abundant and held no value for them. They had no concept of gambling, vice, or rackets, and their language and culture were vastly different from those on Earth. However, with the arrival of the Mafia and other Earth-based criminals, Mars became a hub for various rackets, including the exchange of sugar for precious materials, the establishment of gambling dens, and the infiltration of Communist cells.

2014,"The article discusses the potential for blockchain technology to be used to create a new kind of democracy, one founded on technical means. It highlights the idea that governmental structures at just about every level of society would be replaced by voluntary associations represented as software. Participants in these groups could remain anonymous to one another, if desired, but their identities would be verified, and their votes authenticated, by the same processes that secure the Bitcoin network, meaning that a permanent, secure record of every vote ever taken would be available for all to see.",B,B

2036,"The author would most likely agree with the statement that women's activism can bring a different sensibility to politics, one that acknowledges that emotions are inevitable, messy and necessary. The author argues that the current political mood is anxiety, and that liberals and social democrats have no way of addressing this. The populist right has found an emotive way to engage electorates by channelling their feelings, often displacing them onto someone else in the process.

The author presents ten points to provide a comprehensive answer to this question, examining the existing evidence and considering various factors that could influence the relationship between green OA and toll-access journals. The author also aims to emphasize that even if green OA policies do create risks for toll-access journals, they are still justified as they prioritize the thriving of research over the interests of incumbent publishers.",C,C
2049,"The author feels that there is no concrete evidence to suggest that rising levels of green OA will trigger cancellations of toll-access journals.
