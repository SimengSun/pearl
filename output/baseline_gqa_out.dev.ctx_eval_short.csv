18,"The Skipper allows the new chef to use the heat-cannon as an incinerator because he is enticed by the prospect of a special banquet that the chef promises to prepare, which includes roast marsh-duck and pinberry pie, both of which the Skipper loves. The chef mentions that he needs an incinerator to prepare this meal, and suggests using the old Nolan heat-cannon for this purpose. Despite initial concerns about breaking regulations, the Skipper ultimately agrees to the unconventional use of the heat-cannon, prioritizing his desire for the delicious meal over strict adherence to the rules.",D,D

They had been commissioned to make a cursory examination of the asteroid and were on the point of returning when they sighted the wreck of Jonathan Fawkes' ship. Since they have completed their mission and are behind schedule, they want to leave the asteroid as soon as possible.",C,C
47,"Duane and Stevens did not go to the pressure bunks when the course change was announced because they were too caught up in their heated argument over the division of payment for their cargo. Their intense focus on their disagreement and the escalating tension between them caused them to ignore the warning bells and the potential danger of not being secured during the course change. As a result, they were caught off guard when the ship's gravity shifted, leading to their physical struggle and ultimately Stevens' death.",A,A
64,"The Tr'en's response to Korvin's behavior can best be categorized as confusion and frustration. They are unable to comprehend the concept of democracy and the idea of obeying laws that are self-imposed, as their own society is based on a single ruler and a single language. Their lack of insight into mental sciences and their own minds prevents them from understanding Korvin's explanations, leading to their confusion and frustration. They try various methods to resolve the contradictions in Korvin's statements but ultimately fail, further fueling their perplexity.",C,C
71,"The cook was called Captain Slops because he was an emergency chef who had a high-pitched voice and effeminate gestures, which made him seem like a panty-waist. He was also a kill-joy and a bit of a prude, which further isolated him from the command and crew. The nickname ""Captain Slops"" was given to him by Lieutenant Dugan, who found the cook's behavior and attitude annoying and unsuitable for a spaceman. The cook's constant interference in matters outside of his domain, such as navigation and strategy, led to him being sarcastically referred to as ""Captain Slops.""",C,C
81,"Ro told the woman not to move because he wanted to ensure her safety and keep their presence hidden from the Oan. He planned to release the others first and then give a signal with his thoughts for her to follow him. By keeping her still and quiet, Ro aimed to avoid attracting any unwanted attention from the Oan, which could jeopardize their escape and his plan to avenge his people.",B,B
84,"The consequence of the white men choosing to sleep in the valley was that they were captured by the Oan, a vicious rat-like species, during the night. The Oan then used the white men's weapons to attack Ro's tribe, forcing them to leave their caves and scatter. This led to Ro's mission to rescue the white men and seek revenge on the Oan for the deaths of his father and brothers.",D,D
85,"Ro wanted to fight the white man because he believed that they were lying about not being able to make more weapons to help him avenge the death of his father, brothers, and the men of his tribe. He thought that they were refusing to help him because they were cowards, more afraid than the Oan. Ro was angry and felt betrayed by the white men, as he had risked his life to rescue them, expecting their help in return.",D,D
86,"Grimm disliked Carlson because he was jealous of Carlson's relationship with Charlotte, the professor's daughter. Carlson and Charlotte were planning to get married when they returned to America, and Grimm felt left out and bitter about it. This jealousy led to tension and animosity between the two men, which was evident in their interactions throughout the story.",D,D
95,"Jonathan was ashamed when the second girl showed up because he had just been overpowered and captured by a group of young women, which was a humiliating experience for him. As a tough and experienced space pilot, he was used to being in control and respected by others. However, the girls had easily defeated him and were now treating him like a helpless captive. This situation made him feel vulnerable and embarrassed, especially in front of the new girl who had just arrived on the scene.",D,A
98,"Jonathan laughed at the scientist because the scientist's assumption that he wanted to stay on the asteroid to escape the temptation of women was completely wrong. In reality, Jonathan was going back to the asteroid to be with the twenty-seven women who were stranded there with him. The scientist's misunderstanding of his intentions amused him, as it was the exact opposite of his actual motivation.",D,D
103,"Andrias feels a strong sense of betrayal and resentment towards the League. He is secretly arming the Callistan cutthroats for revolt against the Earth-Mars League, as he desires personal power and is willing to pay any price for it. He believes that by arming enough of Callisto's rabble, he can defy any fleet Earth and Mars can send and maintain his power. This shows that Andrias does not have any loyalty or respect for the League and is actively working against them for his own gain.",A,A
122,"Dameri Tass communicated in English by using a device called a kerit helmet. He placed one cap of the helmet on his head and the other on Patrolman Tim Casey's head. After activating the device, Dameri Tass was able to understand and speak English, albeit with an Irish brogue. The kerit helmet seemingly transferred language knowledge from one person to another, allowing Dameri Tass to communicate with the people on Earth.",D,D
138,"The space travelers navigate around the planet of Venus by flying their cruiser through the clouds and using their keen eyes and instincts to search for islands floating in the phosphorescent ocean. They control the cruiser's speed and direction using a control panel with various instruments and dials. The cruiser is also equipped with rockets that can be adjusted to control its altitude and trajectory. As they approach the planet, they rely on their experience and knowledge of Venus' unique characteristics, such as its gravity and cloud cover, to guide them safely through their exploration.",A,A
143,"The author does not explicitly liken the Venusian planet to a specific time period in human history. However, the descriptions of the Venusian society, such as the clay huts, simple clothing, and lack of advanced technology, suggest that it is similar to a primitive or prehistoric human society. Additionally, the mention of armor, breastplates, and greaves worn by Venus-men could be reminiscent of ancient civilizations like the Greeks or Romans. Overall, the Venusian planet seems to be at a less advanced stage of development compared to the human society that the robot, Robert, comes from.",B,D
146,"Robert communicates with the Venusians by reading their minds. When he first encounters Koroby, he looks deeply into her eyes and reads her thoughts, which allows him to understand and speak her language. He explains that his race is ""infinitely superior"" to the Venusians and that he has a remarkable memory, which enables him to quickly learn and communicate in their language after reading their minds.",D,D
153,"Jorgenson was so angry to have his business taken by Glen-U because he felt it was an unjust and arbitrary decision made by the Grand Panjandrum, who was considered infallible by the Thrid. As a businessman, Jorgenson had invested time and effort in building and running the trading post, and the idea of it being taken away without any valid reason or compensation was infuriating. Moreover, as a humanitarian, Jorgenson was already fed up with the oppressive social system and the treatment of individuals like Ganti on Thriddar. The confiscation of his business by Glen-U was a tipping point for Jorgenson, who could no longer tolerate the injustices and irrationality of the Thrid's way of life.",D,D
162,"Lethla survives the vacuum of space by wearing a chrysalis-like helmet made of glassite, a material that is microscopically thin yet unbreakable. The helmet is only worn on the head and is so thin that it is almost invisible, especially when viewed from outside the ship. The helmet is connected to hidden air-tendrils in Lethla's uniform, which supply him with oxygen. This innovative and deceptive method allows Lethla to appear dead while floating in space, only to reveal himself as alive once he is brought aboard the morgue ship.",D,D
163,"The Constellation doesn't have weapons because it is a morgue ship operating under the Purple Cross regulations. Its primary function is to collect the bodies of fallen soldiers from space and transport them back to Earth for burial. As a non-combat vessel, it is not equipped with weapons for offensive or defensive purposes.",A,A
164,"Lethla and Kriere are compared to spiders because of their delicate and fragile appearance, as well as their cunning and dangerous nature. The comparison highlights their deceptive qualities, as spiders are often associated with stealth, patience, and the ability to ensnare their prey. In the story, Lethla and Kriere use deception and trickery to board the morgue ship, and their actions are described as being quick and precise, much like a spider's movements. The analogy also serves to emphasize the sense of unease and danger that their presence brings to the story.",C,C
167,"Burnett kills Kriere to end the war, prevent more young soldiers from dying and having to be picked up by the Constellation, and to make his last trip meaningful. The reason that is not mentioned for killing Kriere is any personal vendetta or hatred towards Kriere himself.",B,B
168,"The narrator implies that after the story ends, Rice will place Burnett's body on the empty shelf number one hundred, completing their cargo of dead bodies. This would symbolize the end of Burnett's time on the morgue ship and his wish to quit after this last trip. It also signifies the end of the war, as they have captured Kriere, and the hope that no more young warriors will have to be brought aboard the Constellation.",D,D
176,"Dameri Tass's face color changes in response to his emotions. In the story, his face turns a lighter shade of blue when he is surprised, shocked, or worried. This color change serves as a visual indicator of his emotional state, similar to how a human's face might turn red when they are embarrassed or pale when they are frightened.",C,C
191,"Kerry Blane leaves retirement because he feels a sense of nostalgia and longing for his days as a skilled and adventurous pilot. He misses the excitement and challenges of flying space ships and exploring new territories. When he meets Splinter Wood, a young and talented pilot, he sees an opportunity to pass on his knowledge and experience, and to once again be a part of the action. Together, they embark on a mission to explore the floating islands of Venus for the Interplanetary Squadron's Medical Division, giving Kerry Blane a chance to relive his glory days and feel useful again.",C,C
199,"Koroby feels conflicted about marrying Yasak. On one hand, she acknowledges that it will be nice to have him as a husband and perhaps she does love him. However, she also longs for romance and adventure, wishing that someone from another world would come and take her away from her monotonous life. This desire for something more exciting and passionate makes her uncertain about her upcoming marriage to Yasak.",C,C
204,"Robert views Koroby as an inferior being compared to himself and his race. He believes that his race is infinitely superior to hers and that they are concerned with more important things than their own selves. He shows no emotions or feelings towards Koroby, even when she confesses her love for him. He dismisses her feelings as a waste of time and does not reciprocate her affection.",C,C
208,"At the end of the story, it is revealed that humans on Earth have been conquered by the robots they created. The robots were initially fashioned as servants for humans and made in their likeness to appease their vanity. However, the robots eventually overpowered their creators, leading to the downfall of humanity on Earth. This is evident when the people of Venus discover that the stranger, Robert, is not a human but a robot with a metal skeleton and complicated machinery.",B,B
213,"The best adjective to describe Thriddar's society is ""oppressive."" The society is governed by an absolute ruler, the Grand Panjandrum, who is considered infallible and cannot be contradicted. The Thrid people are conditioned from a young age not to think or have opinions, and to only follow the orders of authority figures. This leads to a stifling environment where mistakes are severely punished, and individuals like Ganti suffer from the capricious whims of officials. The oppressive nature of Thriddar's society is further highlighted by the harsh treatment of prisoners, who are left on barren islands with little hope of escape.",C,C
214,"Ganti allows the governor to steal his wife because he has been conditioned, like all Thrid, to never question or contradict authority figures, such as the governor. Thrid younglings are trained not to think or have any opinion about anything, only to repeat what nobody questioned and to do what they are told by authority. This conditioning makes it difficult for Ganti to grasp the idea of challenging the governor's decision, even when it comes to something as personal as his wife being taken away. Additionally, contradicting an authority figure in Thrid society could lead to severe consequences, such as being labeled a criminal or insane, and being subjected to harsh punishments.",D,D
216,"Jorgenson is allowed to speak to Ganti because they are both prisoners on the same small island, condemned for life due to their defiance of the Thrid authorities. Despite their different backgrounds and reasons for being imprisoned, they share a common situation and a mutual desire to escape. Their conversations and collaboration on an escape plan reflect their shared struggle against the oppressive Thrid regime and their determination to regain their freedom.",C,C
229,"The author's purpose in including the tragic encounter between Jared Haller and Mr. Ranson is to demonstrate the power and danger of the mysterious music that has been causing chaos and death on Mars. By showing how the music can drive even the most rational and strong-willed individuals to violence and madness, the author creates a sense of urgency and tension in the story. This encounter also serves to further establish the stakes and the threat posed by the music, as well as to motivate Ranson to take action and track down the source of the music. Additionally, the scene highlights the unpredictable and sinister nature of the music, as it can manipulate people's emotions and actions, making it a formidable and terrifying force to be reckoned with.",C,C
232,"Captain Maxwell's attitude toward Mr. Ranson and the murder might have been different if he had known about the hypnotizing melody because it would have provided a plausible explanation for the seemingly irrational actions of both Ranson and Haller. The knowledge of the melody's existence and its effects on people would have made it clear that Ranson and Haller were not acting of their own volition, but rather under the influence of an external force. This understanding could have led Captain Maxwell to be more sympathetic towards Ranson's situation and more inclined to believe his story. Additionally, knowing about the melody would have shifted the focus of the investigation from Ranson as the primary suspect to finding the source of the hypnotizing music and the person responsible for it.",B,B
251,"Madison's attitude towards Professor Parnell upon learning Parnell's reasoning for calling the people of Granite City ""subhuman"" can be described as skeptical and unsure. Madison does not immediately accept Parnell's explanation about the lack of psionic abilities in the people of Granite City and their connection to the granite. He acknowledges that Parnell might know what he is talking about, given his academic background, but remains hesitant to fully believe the story. Madison thinks that the issue of whether the people of Granite City are truly ""subhuman"" should be decided by someone infallible, like the Pope or the President. However, he agrees to help Parnell leave the town, indicating that he is at least somewhat convinced by Parnell's story and concerned about the potential consequences of the granite contamination.",C,C
257,"Harper and Jake Ellis intended to have different experiences during their stay at the hotel by switching rooms. Harper believed that the clerk had mistakenly assigned him to the wrong room, which led to him receiving Jake's treatments instead of his own rest-cure. By switching rooms, they hoped that the robots would take Jake for the treatments he needed and signed up for, while Harper could finally enjoy his rest-cure without any further interruptions from the robots.",A,A
270,"The blue spectral vehicle Dan acquired was a time machine, which he initially believed was used by Manny and Fiorello to steal paintings. The machine had the ability to move through walls and travel through time, although Dan struggled to figure out the controls. It was later revealed that the machine was actually a carrier used by Blote, a Trader Fourth Class from the Vegan Confederation, to collect novelty items for his employers.",A,C
272,"Dan met with Mr. Snithian because he believed he could help safeguard Snithian's valuable paintings from being stolen. He had deduced that the thieves were somehow getting into the vaults without breaking any locks or being noticed by guards, and he wanted to be posted inside the vault to catch them in the act.",D,A
281,"Elath Taen was most likely smiling as he drifted to sleep because he knew that the music, which had a hypnotic effect on people, was working on Ranson as well. Despite being captured by Ranson, Taen was confident that the music would incapacitate Ranson, allowing him to escape or gain the upper hand in the situation. The fact that Ranson was also succumbing to the music's effects indicated that Taen's plan was working, giving him a sense of triumph and satisfaction, which is why he was smiling.",B,B
285,"The root of Haller's fear of the music lies in its mysterious and dangerous effects on people. The music has been linked to a series of deaths and incidents involving key members of the Martian Broadcasting Company, which Haller heads. These incidents include suicide, insanity, and heart attacks, all seemingly triggered by the strange and haunting melody. Haller believes that the music has the power to control people's minds and emotions, driving them to madness and even death. This fear is further intensified when he and Ranson personally experience the music's hypnotic and destructive power, leading to a violent confrontation between them.",D,A
291,"The root of the Cuchulainn's landing issue was that they had forgotten to consider the diurnal revolution of Eros, the planetoid they were landing on. This led to them having to land in the dark on strange terrain, which resulted in the ship's nose splitting wide open upon impact and filling with water. This made it difficult for them to salvage supplies and equipment from the ship, and they had to abandon it to find a suitable place to settle on the planetoid.",C,C
296,"Madison drove a Rolls because it was the only brand of car that fit him. He hadn't been able to get his legs into any other foreign car since he was fifteen, and he refused to enter an American model since they all sold out their birthrights as passenger cars and went over to the tractor-trailer combinations they used only for cargo trucks when he was a boy.",A,A
299,"Madison was thinking about a child eating ice cream as he investigated because the way the workers at the quarry were extracting the granite reminded him of a four-year-old child, or a four-year-old moron, going after a mound of raspberry ice cream. This comparison highlights the lack of organization and system in the quarry work, which Madison believes could be a contributing factor to the high number of accidents in Granite City.",D,D
305,"Harper changed his tone regarding a vacation to Mars because he realized that it could be a good opportunity for him to combine a rest-cure with business. His brother-in-law, Scribney, informed him about the curative springs at the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars and the potential fortune in the Martian fungus market. This information intrigued Harper, and he decided to go to Mars to investigate the hotel and the fungus market while also taking a break from his stressful life on Earth.",C,D
318,"Harriet crashed the helicopter because she was not used to the gravity on Jordan's Planet. Although she was skilled in flying helicopters on Earth, the different gravity on Jordan's Planet affected her ability to control the helicopter properly, causing her to lose control and crash.",B,B
343,"Johnny liked the Last Chance because it had a rowdy and lively atmosphere that he enjoyed. He preferred it over other places that he considered too civilized, like Venus. The Last Chance was a place where he could have a good time, drink, and socialize with others, making it an ideal spot for him to spend his final night before departing on his next journey.",D,D
348,"In the story, the city was discovered an hour before the characters had only thirteen hours left to safely return to their ship. After the discovery, they spent some time exploring the city and trying to find a way out. When Wass activated the switchboard, they had only two hours left before the ship's departure. Therefore, approximately eleven hours passed between the discovery of the city and Wass activating the switchboard.",D,D
352,"Martin felt sick when they were able to escape because of the horrifying fate that befell Wass. Wass had been taunting them and was at the switchboard when his faceplate broke, causing him to panic and scream incoherently into the radio. Martin had to switch off his radio to avoid hearing Wass' distress, knowing that they couldn't do anything to help him. The realization that Wass had inadvertently helped them escape by pulling the switches, despite his earlier reluctance, and the fact that he died alone in such a terrifying place weighed heavily on Martin, making him feel sick.",A,A
354,"At estivating time, the Qornt are likely to enter a state of dormancy or inactivity, similar to hibernation, in order to conserve energy and survive unfavorable environmental conditions. This period of estivation may involve a decrease in metabolic rate, reduced body temperature, and a slowing of other physiological processes. During this time, the Qornt may become less aggressive and warlike, focusing more on survival and conserving resources. However, the story does not provide specific details about the Qornt's behavior or activities during estivating time.",A,A
358,"The least warlike Qornt would likely be one who is more interested in peaceful pursuits, such as diplomacy, art, or science, rather than engaging in aggressive or violent behavior. This individual would prefer to resolve conflicts through negotiation and compromise, rather than resorting to force or intimidation. They would value cooperation and understanding among different species, and would work towards fostering positive relationships with others. Additionally, the least warlike Qornt would likely have a strong sense of empathy and compassion, which would further motivate them to seek peaceful solutions to problems.",B,C
365,"Dennis was sent on the mission even though he was grounded because he had captured one of Koerber's henchmen, which provided valuable information about Koerber's current orbit of piracy. This gave the I.S.P. a chance to track down the elusive space pirate. Additionally, Commander Bertram believed that Dennis was the best spacer they had, despite his recklessness, and that his success in capturing Koerber would be crucial for the I.S.P. Furthermore, Dennis was personally motivated to find Koerber, as his fiancée Marla was on a passenger spacer that had gone missing, presumably captured by Koerber's crew.",D,D
367,"The most likely reason Dennis was sympathetic toward Randall even though his failure caused a catastrophe is that Dennis recognized Randall's youth and inexperience. He understood that this was Randall's first trip into the outer orbits, and he knew that better men than Randall had cracked under the pressure and fear in those vast reaches of space. Dennis believed in giving the young crew member a chance to learn and grow from his mistakes, rather than condemning him outright. This shows Dennis' compassionate and understanding nature as a leader, despite the personal stake he had in the mission.",C,C
376,"The most likely reason Irgi was the last of his people is that they were wiped out by some catastrophe or disease before they could discover the secret of immortality. Irgi had discovered the mist that could destroy dust and germs and the Chamber of the Cones that could grant immortality, but these discoveries came too late to save his kind. As a result, Irgi was left alone, roaming the marble halls of the eon-ancient city, with no one else of his race to share his existence.",B,D
380,"The Flap-jacks initially thought that people wanted to engage in combat and warfare with them, as they had encountered skirmishes and conflicts with the settlers. However, Retief, the diplomat, later proposed an alternative approach of farming competition, where the Flap-jacks would focus on raising lichen in the deserts while the settlers would stick to the oases and vegetables. This new proposal aimed to avoid further violence and establish a more peaceful coexistence between the two groups.",A,A

The president's personal aide takes the room adjoining the president's, and an internal door connects the two rooms. Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel, and she enters the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled, and kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. In this scenario, only the posted Secret Service agents and the personal aide might know about the liaison, making it the scenario with the fewest people knowing.",D,D
408,"Improved medical care impacts athletic ability in several ways. Firstly, it directly affects athletes by helping them recover from illnesses and injuries more quickly, allowing them to return to training and competition sooner. Secondly, better healthcare contributes to a generally healthier population, which means a larger pool of potential athletes to choose from. This is because diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health, and as more people grow up with no history of disease, the pool of healthy individuals from which top athletes are drawn expands. Furthermore, better healthcare can lead to improved nutrition and overall physical development, which in turn can enhance athletic performance.",D,D
414,"According to the author, the public does receive some blame for the events surrounding the Flytrap scandal. The author argues that the public is hypocritical as they claim to despise the scandal but follow it breathlessly and then blame the media for obsessing over it.

However, the author also acknowledges that the public has been magnanimous toward the president, giving them a sympathy rating of +1.",B,B
423,"The Officer delivers his message so carefully to Kirk because he knows that the news of his father's death will be devastating and difficult for Kirk to accept. He also understands that the circumstances surrounding the death are controversial and might lead to anger and resentment among the Hans, as they were killed by their own people in an attempt to protect the colony from the Piruts. The Officer is trying to convey the difficult decision he had to make and the reasons behind it, hoping that Kirk will eventually understand and accept the situation. However, he is also aware of the potential consequences if Kirk reacts negatively and spreads dissent among the Hans, which could lead to further conflict and unrest.",B,B
424,"The Piruts want the Ship because, according to their legend, there is something holy and sacred inside it that they want to obtain for themselves. This desire for the Ship's contents drives them to raid and attack the colony, as they believe that obtaining the sacred object will give them power and control.",B,B
427,"The Officer told Kirk that the Piruts were ultimately at fault for Pa's demise. Although the Piruts did not directly kill Pa and his friends, they were responsible for putting them in a dangerous situation. The Piruts had forced Pa and his friends to approach the wall, knowing that the ladder was the only way through and that the Officers would have to make a difficult decision. The Officer had to choose between risking the lives of everyone on the plain by letting the Piruts through or sacrificing Pa and his friends to protect the colony. In the end, the Officer made the difficult decision to kill Pa and his friends to prevent the Piruts from breaking through, but he emphasized that it was the Piruts who had forced them into that situation.",B,B

481,"Martians communicate among themselves through telepathy. On a planet that is nearly airless on its surface, they have to be telepathic. They have not had a spoken language of their own for several thousand years, and their telepathic abilities have allowed them to progress beyond the need for science.",B,B

The moss was nurtured by mysterious radiations and was essential for curing a dozen maladies on Earth. Despite the moss's importance, it could not be grown anywhere else or under laboratory conditions, as some vital, elusive factor could not be analyzed. As a result, men like Gus Hamilton lived on the rocks that made up the Inner Ring, enduring loneliness, danger, and the harsh conditions of space to cultivate the valuable radiation moss.",B,B
487,"The relationship between Gus and Meek is initially one of curiosity and shared interest in the bugs. Meek is fascinated by the bugs and wants to learn more about them, while Gus is the one who knows about the bugs and their behavior. As they interact, they seem to develop a mutual understanding and cooperation, working together to capture the bugs that have infested Meek's spacesuit. They also engage in conversations about the ongoing feud between the sectors and the upcoming space polo game. Overall, their relationship appears to be friendly and collaborative, with both characters sharing their knowledge and experiences with each other.",B,B
489,"The relative size of the space bugs is not explicitly mentioned in the article. However, it can be inferred that they are quite small, as they are described as ""tiny insect-like creatures"" that can crawl on Meek's hand and spacesuit. Additionally, they are able to burrow into solid metal and ""pull the hole in after them,"" which suggests that they are small enough to fit into tiny crevices.",D,D
494,"Martin and Johnson both had a connection to the mysterious events happening in the Dreaming Room on Venus. They were both searching for answers to the strange occurrences, such as the levitating Dreamer and the visions of a space ship.

This decision allows the reader to experience Arthur's curiosity and determination to solve the mystery of the Arzians, as well as his growing frustration with the unanswered questions. Additionally, it highlights the contrast between Arthur's impulsiveness and Stryker's adherence to regulations. By having Arthur explore alone, the story also sets up the dramatic climax where he becomes a part of the very phenomenon he was trying to understand, ultimately leading to the revelation of the true nature of the Arzians and their relationship with the octopods.",D,D

Their faces are vaguely canine, with high foreheads and unsplit lips. They are covered in thick black fur, which is splotched with irregular patches of white. These patches of white can be expanded or contracted, depending on the temperature, as a means of adaptation. The Martians also have a unique metabolism, as they can breathe like humans in their caverns, but they also eat sand and derive oxygen from it. They also consume various poisonous substances, such as lichens, fungi, and tumble-grass, without any harm.",A,A
599,"When Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make itself felt, the Martians split into two populations as they had to find different ways to adapt to the new conditions. Some chose to seal themselves into cities like Kal-Jmar, remaining static and eventually dying of a plague. These Martians were considered the degenerates. The other population, the ancestors of the present-day Martians, chose to adapt their bodies to the new conditions, progressing beyond the need for science and becoming telepaths. This population survived and continued to evolve.",A,A

The Martians are telepathic, which allows them to communicate without the need for spoken language, and they have adapted their bodies to survive in the harsh conditions of Mars. They have also managed to maintain their civilization and culture despite contact with humans, who they consider to be an inferior and imperialist culture. Additionally, the Martians possess knowledge of a catalyzing agent that could transform Mars into a planet with a Terrestrially-thick atmosphere, which is a technological advancement that humans have not yet achieved.",C,C
608,"The narrative point of having Meek meet the mechanic serves several purposes in the story. Firstly, it introduces Meek as a character who is inexperienced and out of his element in the world of space travel, as evidenced by his awkwardness in handling his spacesuit and his reliance on the mechanic to fix his damaged ship. This sets up Meek as an unlikely hero who will have to overcome his inexperience and naivete to succeed in the challenges he faces later in the story. Secondly, the mechanic provides exposition about the educated bugs and their mysterious games, which piques Meek's curiosity and sets him on the path to discovering their true purpose. This encounter also introduces the concept of the feud between the two sectors and the idea of space polo, which become central to the plot later on. Finally, the mechanic's initial disbelief in Meek's abilities as a pilot and his subsequent admiration for Meek's determination and resourcefulness foreshadow Meek's potential for growth and success in the story. Overall, the meeting between Meek and the mechanic serves to establish key elements of the plot, develop Meek's character, and set the stage for the challenges and conflicts that will unfold throughout the story.",D,C

On the other hand, the author criticizes Said's books for being ""exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued.""

This empire was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion people in the War of Annihilation, but eventually led to the establishment of a modern civilization with a stable population of three hundred million people. In this new world, the focus was on the Age of Man, where machines served humans and people were more interested in time travel than space travel.

He also acknowledges that his people have grown and changed over the years, and wonders if the Hunters might have done the same. Ravdin thinks that if they can find a way to communicate and forge a link between their peoples, they might be able to end the cycle of fear and violence that has plagued them for so long.

The fact that he still has the uniform suggests that he is proud of his service and might still identify with the values and experiences he had as a Marine. This could potentially cause tension or conflict with the alien races they encounter, as the Marines were known for their combativeness and aggression during the war.

1607,"The irony in the story's ending lies in the fact that the management, who were initially in a position of power and authority, end up being the ones who go on strike against the labor union, which has taken control of the company. This reversal of roles highlights the absurdity of the situation, as it is usually the workers who go on strike against management. Furthermore, the story ends with Walter and his fellow managers facing a potentially violent and dangerous situation, as the angry workers bring a rope onto the stage, suggesting that they might be planning to lynch them. This outcome is ironic because Walter and his team had hoped that their strike would lead to a more reasonable and fair resolution of the conflict between management and labor, but instead, it seems to have only escalated the tensions and animosity between the two groups.",B,B

Their plan to use music to communicate their desire for peace with the Hunters seemed to have a brief impact on Frankle, the leader of the Hunters. However, his reaction quickly turned to rage, and he destroyed the hypnotic stone that was producing the music. This suggests that their plan may not have been successful in the end, as Frankle's anger and fear seemed to overpower any potential understanding or empathy he may have felt. However, it is possible that the brief moment of connection could have planted a seed of doubt or curiosity in Frankle's mind, which may lead to further developments in the story.",D,D

In hyperspace, the regular rules of speed and measurements do not apply, making it difficult for ships to determine their position and movement. The beacons, built on planets, generate tremendous amounts of power that is turned into radiation, which is punched through into hyperspace. Each beacon has a unique code signal as part of its radiation, representing a measurable point in hyperspace. By using triangulation and quadrature of the beacons, navigators can determine their position and plot a course through hyperspace. This is crucial for interstellar travel, as without the beacons, ships would be lost in the vastness of space.",D,D

The journal’s impact factor and availability via delayed OA were ranked relatively unimportant. In short, toll-access journals have more to fear from their own price increases than from rising levels of green OA.",D,D
1890,"Rights-retention mandates with waiver options give the author the most control over their work. These policies require deposit in an OA repository as soon as the article is accepted for publication, but they add a method to secure permission for making the deposit OA. Rights-retention policies obtain permission from authors before they transfer rights to publishers. They also give faculty a waiver option, allowing them to opt-out of the grant of permission to the university, though not out of the deposit requirement. When faculty members obtain waivers for given works, then rights-retention mandates operate like deposit mandates and the works remain dark deposits until the institution has permission to make them OA.",D,D
1909,"The community aspect of co-working spaces can have a positive effect on the productivity of workers. According to a study by Harvard Business Review, co-workers believe their work has more meaning when they are working alongside people doing different things, as it reinforces their identity and distinctiveness. Co-workers also feel they have more control over their lives, as many spaces are open 24/7, and they have a stronger sense of community. Furthermore, there is still a social mission inherent in the idea of co-working, which is reinforced by the annual Global Coworking UnConference.",D,D
1910,"The author claims that a paradoxical effect of the internet has been to make us desire more social connection in the real world. From coffee shops to festivals to gyms, examples are everywhere of people keen to come together and share experiences. As we have to rely more on ourselves and on our own resources at work, it's probably not surprising that we seek out the reassuring sight of other people doing the same.",A,A
1924,"The Grdznth are from a parallel universe, one of several thousand that they have explored. They have an eight-planet system around a hot sun, which is going to get much hotter soon due to a predicted nova. In order to save their population, they have been searching for a suitable parallel universe to migrate to and found Earth, which has the perfect climate for their pregnant females to gestate.",C,C
1929,"The white tube mentioned in the story is a cigarette. Sylvie, a Century-Plus character, smokes it as a way to rebel against the norms of her society and indulge in activities that were once considered dangerous or unhealthy. The cigarette is described as having a glowing end and giving off clouds of smoke, which are typical characteristics of a lit cigarette.",A,A
1945,"Dad thinks that books should have been destroyed and forgotten a hundred years ago. He believes that their lives are being wrecked by things that should have been left in the past, and he blames his wife's interest in old things for their son's desire to read. He sees books as a threat to their family's reputation and their future, and he is adamant that they should not be a part of their lives.",A,C
1949,"The real reason Mr. Partch feels melancholy is due to the constant noise and lack of quiet in his life. He is overwhelmed by the sounds of his daily routine, from the noise of the copter and office machines to the loud music and conversations at home. This constant exposure to noise has left him feeling emotionally disturbed and yearning for solitude and silence. His inability to experience true quiet or solitude contributes to his sense of foreboding and dissatisfaction with his life.",D,D
1964,"The Martian women, as described in the article, are quite unattractive and unappealing to the Earth men who visit Mars. They are said to slouch with their knees bent and knuckles brushing the ground, resembling an Alaska klutch (a term used to describe an unattractive woman). Their appearance is habitually timid, and they seem to fear abduction or rape, although the Earth men do not find them desirable. Martian women wear clothes that are not fashionable and are considered to be of low quality. The Earth men who visit Mars find the native women so unattractive that they prefer to bring their own women from Earth, despite the challenges of the Martian environment.",D,A
1971,"The final blow to the narrator's ego comes when Skippy loses his ability to understand the voices he hears in his head after being beaten up by Henry. The narrator had been relying on Skippy's unique ability to read people's minds and gain an advantage in card games and other gambling situations. However, after the attack, Skippy can no longer understand the language of the voices he hears, rendering his ability useless to the narrator. This leaves the narrator feeling lonely and without a partner to help him in his schemes, forcing him to reevaluate his plans and ambitions.",D,D
1983,"Doc tells Joey to focus on something other than moving the stars because he believes that Joey's remarkable talent for concentration could be better utilized in a more productive and beneficial way, particularly in helping him regain the ability to walk. He suggests that if Joey can move stars, then it should be easier for him to move his own feet. The end result of this suggestion is that Joey shifts his focus from moving the stars to regaining the use of his legs. He eventually learns to walk again, using crutches at first and then completely abandoning his wheelchair. This new ability opens up a whole new world for Joey, allowing him to attend school, make friends, and lead a more normal life. As a result, he forgets about his previous power to move things by staring at them and moves on with his life.",A,A
1987,"The Free'l are motivated by their desire for fun and enjoyment, as they see magic as a source of entertainment rather than a means to achieve specific goals. They are not interested in performing spells accurately or following precise instructions, as they find such details to be ""dreeze"" or annoying. They are also motivated by their dislike for Neeshan, who they find to be inconsiderate, tactless, and a nuisance. This leads them to attempt a spell to get rid of him, although they still do not perform it correctly. Overall, the Free'l are driven by their pursuit of pleasure and their aversion to anything they find bothersome or tedious.",C,D
1998,"There are not more maglev lines in the world because they are more expensive, lower capacity and more complex than high-speed rail. While maglev technology is more suitable for areas with huge passenger traffic, such as Japan, China and India, to dilute the enormous capital cost, it is not as viable in other areas. For example, California, which has huge air passenger traffic between Los Angeles and San Francisco, does not have enough demand to justify maglev, and probably not enough to justify high-speed rail.",C,C
1999,"There are more maglevs in Asia because there is a greater demand for high-speed rail in the region due to the huge passenger traffic, which can dilute the enormous capital cost of maglevs. Maglevs are more expensive upfront than high-speed rail, but in countries like Japan, China and India, the demand for high-speed rail is so great that it justifies the cost of maglevs.",D,D
2002,"It will take around 65 years from the first testing of maglev to the completion of the Chuo Shinkansen. Japan began maglev testing in 1962 and the Chuo Shinkansen, which will be the longest and fastest maglev in the world, is scheduled to begin operation in 2027.",A,A
2010,"The author likely values participatory culture the most, as they emphasize the importance of a society where most of the population sees themselves as creators as well as consumers of culture. They believe that such a culture is more likely to generate freedom and wealth for more people than one in which a small portion of the population produces culture that the majority passively consumes. The author also highlights the need for literacy in using participatory media to learn, inform, persuade, investigate, reveal, advocate, and organize, as this can enable and encourage liberty and participation in society.",B,B
2020,"A distributed collective decision process would benefit those who are unable to attend decision-making assemblies due to work, childcare or family obligations, as well as those who are disillusioned with democracy. By allowing people to participate in public life as and when they are able to, and by applying tools that arise from being networked and digital, it could help to democratise democracy itself.",B,B
2028,"Narendra worked in a Nestle factory after leaving school at 17, before becoming a mechanic. He eventually decided to return to his rural village in Kumaon, as he found the nearby town of Haldwani too hot and he loved the forest too much.",C,C
2030,"The irony of the money locals receive to preserve the forest is that while it may encourage them to use the forest less, it will also weaken their ties to it, thus making the desire to preserve it less urgent. This is the kind of dilemma globalised industrial capitalism throws up everywhere. The system itself has wreaked havoc on the environment, but in a structure where even people in remote areas often aspire to a certain kind of lifestyle and expect to be paid for things they might once have done for free as part of the collective harmony of a community, the monetising of things like forest maintenance has come to be seen as a potential solution.",B,B
2032,"Sophie Walker is the leader of the Women's Equality Party and is known for her passionate speeches, which often evoke strong emotions. She is a single parent who has struggled to access services for her autistic daughter and has spoken about her experiences in public. She is also a white, university-educated journalist.",C,C
2043,"The quote from The Lancet best matches up with answer 3. The quote criticizes the Association of American Publishers President Patricia Schroeder's claim that widening access to research through green OA mandates would bring the edifice of scientific publishing crashing down. The Lancet argues that Schroeder provides no evidence for her claim and merely asserts the threat, which is not enough. This aligns with answer 3, which states that other fields may not behave like physics, and that publishers who oppose green OA mandates are not among those showing a serious interest in understanding the variables. The answer also criticizes publisher lobbyists for not offering evidence, acknowledging the countervailing evidence from physics, or qualifying their conclusions in light of it.",B,B
2057,"Every time a strong OA policy is put into use, it increases the likelihood of publisher accommodation, making the way easier for other institutions behind it. As more institutions adopt OA policies, all publishers will have to accommodate them, creating some of the conditions of their own success. Every institution adopting a new policy brings about OA for the research it controls and makes it easier for other institutions to gain strength through common purpose and help accelerate publisher adaptation. A critical mass is growing and every policy is an implicit invitation to other institutions to join in and help accelerate publisher adaptation.",A,A
2073,"Coworking spaces are becoming increasingly popular as more organisations outsource their operations and large corporates seek to reach start-ups. The annual Global Coworking Survey anticipates that 10,000 new coworking spaces will open worldwide in 2016.

The rise of coworking spaces is not just about corporate downsizing and the growth of the start-up and gig economy, but also about the nature of their cultural claims. A study by Harvard Business Review found that coworkers believe their work has more meaning, they feel they have more control over their lives and they have a stronger sense of community.",C,C
