6. ans = CONCAT(skipper_decision, incinerator_event) : Combine the Skipper's decision and the incinerator event to form the final answer","The Skipper, also referred to as Captain O'Hara, is the captain of the spaceship Leo. He is described as a bit of a sybarite and is in command of the ship during its mission to run the Outer Planets Alliance blockade and reach Jupiter's fourth satellite, Callisto. The Skipper is responsible for hiring Andy Laney, the new cook, and interacts with him throughout the story.


The new chef in the input article is Andy Laney, a slim, trim, natty little Earthman not more than five-foot-two in height, with a smooth-cheeked young face and a high-pitched, but not unpleasant voice. He is hired as a cook on the spaceship Leo and is referred to as ""Captain Slops"" throughout the story.


The heat-cannon is an old Nolan heat cannon that was rusting in the storeroom of the ship Leo. It is mentioned in the following paragraphs:

- ""There's an old Nolan heat-cannon rusting in the storeroom. If that could be installed by the galley vent, I could use it as an incinerator.""
- ""During the night watch two men of the crew lugged the ancient Nolan heat cannon from stores and I went below to check. I found young Slops bent over the old cannon, giving it a strenuous and thorough cleaning.""
- ""I said, ""Hold everything, Slops! You can't do that! It's against regulations. Code 44, Section xvi, says, 'Fixed armament shall be placed only in gunnery embrasures insulated against the repercussions of firing charges, re-radiation, or other hazards accruent to heavy ordnance.'""
- ""I had finished my inspection, and I sniggered as his words reminded me of a joke I'd heard at a spacemans' smoker.""


The decision to allow the new chef to use the heat-cannon as an incinerator was influenced by several factors:

1. The ship's need for a cook: The crew was desperate for a cook, and the new chef, Andy Laney, volunteered for the job. The captain was willing to accommodate his requests to ensure the crew was well-fed and in top physical condition for their mission.

2. The chef's culinary skills: Andy Laney proved to be an excellent cook, preparing delicious meals for the crew. This made the captain more inclined to fulfill his request for an incinerator to improve the galley's waste disposal system.

3. The promise of a special banquet: Andy Laney mentioned that he was planning a special banquet with roast marsh-duck and pinberry pie, which the captain was particularly fond of. The captain's desire for this meal made him more willing to bend the rules and allow the installation of the heat-cannon as an incinerator.

4. The lack of proper equipment: The ship did not have the necessary equipment to install a proper incinerator, but Andy Laney suggested using the old Nolan heat-cannon as a makeshift solution. The captain agreed to this unconventional approach to solve the waste disposal issue in the galley.

The event where the new chef, Andy Laney, uses the heat-cannon as an incinerator occurs when he requests Captain O'Hara to install an old Nolan heat-cannon in the galley to dispose of garbage. Despite Lieutenant Dugan's warning that it is against regulations, Captain O'Hara agrees to the installation, enticed by the promise of a special banquet featuring roast marsh-duck and pinberry pie. Andy Laney cleans and prepares the heat-cannon for use as an incinerator, assuring the captain and Dugan that he will be careful with it.

Doctor Boynton, a tall elderly man with a small black waxed mustache and Van Dyke, introduces himself as a member of the society. He explains that they have been commissioned to make a cursory examination of the asteroid and were about to return when they spotted the wreck.

In the input article, the asteroid is mentioned as the location where Jonathan Fawkes, a space pilot, crash-lands and finds himself stranded with twenty-seven women who were also shipwrecked there three years prior. The asteroid has a smaller size and less gravity than Earth's moon, which gives the inhabitants increased strength. The landscape consists of a vast rolling prairie, jagged foothills, mountains, a stream, and trees. The asteroid is also inhabited by centaurs, and its orbit brings it back into the space lanes every three years.

The Interstellar Cosmography Society is in a hurry to get off the asteroid because they are already a week overdue for their return.

Duane is the protagonist who wakes up with amnesia and is accused of killing Stevens, a white-haired man. They both seem to be involved in a gun-running operation, supplying weapons to Governor Andrias on Callisto. Duane is struggling to remember his past and understand his role in the events unfolding around him, while Stevens is killed in an accident during a course change on their spaceship.

The event involving the course change announcement occurs when Peter Duane and the white-haired man, Stevens, are arguing in the ship's corridor. During their heated argument, the public announcement (P.A.) speaker blares something unintelligible, which neither man pays attention to. A muted alarm bell then sounds through the P.A. speakers, signaling a one-minute warning for the course change. The ship reaches the midpoint of its flight, and the bells warn everyone on board to take shelter and strap themselves in their pressure bunks against the deadly stress of acceleration as the ship reverses itself and begins to slow its headlong plunge into Callisto. However, Duane and Stevens do not heed the warning and continue their struggle, resulting in them being caught off-guard and injured when the course change occurs.

Pressure bunks are mentioned in the following paragraph: ""The small steering rockets flashed briefly. The men were thrust bruisingly against the side of the corridor as the rocket spun lazily on its axis. The side jets flared once more to halt the spin, when the one-eighty turn was completed, and the men were battered against the opposite wall, still weightless, still clinging to each other, still struggling."" 

Pressure bunks are a safety feature in spaceships, designed for passengers and crew to strap themselves in during high acceleration or course changes to protect them from the potentially deadly stress and forces experienced during such maneuvers.

Duane and Stevens did not go to the pressure bunks when the course change was announced because they were engaged in a heated argument over the division of payment for their cargo. They were so focused on their disagreement that they ignored the warning bells and continued their confrontation, ultimately leading to a physical struggle between them. This distraction caused them to miss the opportunity to secure themselves in the pressure bunks, resulting in them being caught in the dangerous acceleration forces during the course change.

They are highly efficient, logical, and scientifically advanced, having developed technologies such as hypnopædic language courses and lie-detector machines. The Tr'en are on the verge of developing space travel and faster-than-light travel, which could potentially make them a threat to the rest of the galaxy. Their society is governed by a single Ruler, who is adopted by the previous Ruler to ensure continuity and stability.


Korvin is the protagonist of the story, a human who has crash-landed on the planet of the Tr'en. He is a captive of the Tr'en and is subjected to their questioning and lie-detector tests. His mission is to prevent the Tr'en from becoming a threat to the rest of the galaxy by confusing them with the concept of democracy, which they cannot understand due to their highly logical and efficient nature.


""You are Korvin,"" he said.

""You are of the Tr'en,"" he replied. The green being nodded.

""I am Didyak of the Tr'en,"" he said. Amenities over with, he relaxed slightly—but no more than slightly—and came into the cell, closing the door behind him. Korvin thought of jumping the Tr'en, but decided quickly against it. He was a captive, and it was unwise to assume that his captors had no more resources than the ones he saw: a small translucent pistollike affair in a holster at the Tr'en's side, and a small knife in a sheath at the belt. Those Korvin could deal with; but there might be almost anything else hidden and ready to fire on him.

""What do you want with me?"" Korvin said. The Tr'en speech—apparently there was only one language on the planet—was stiff and slightly awkward, but easily enough learned under drug hypnosis; it was the most rigorously logical construction of its kind Korvin had ever come across. It reminded him of some of the mathematical metalanguages he'd dealt with back on Earth, in training; but it was more closely and carefully constructed than even those marvels.

""I want nothing with you,"" Didyak said, leaning against the door-frame. ""You have other questions?""

Korvin sighed. ""What are you doing here, then?"" he asked. As conversation, it wasn't very choice; but it was, he admitted, better than solitude.

""I am leaning against the door,"" Didyak said. The Tr'en literalist approach to the smallest problems of everyday living was a little hard to get the hang of, Korvin told himself bitterly. He thought for a second.

""Why did you come to me?"" he said at last.

Didyak beamed at him. The sight was remarkably unpleasant, involving as it did the disclosure of the Tr'en fifty-eight teeth, mostly pointed. Korvin stared back impassively. ""I have been ordered to come to you,"" Didyak said, ""by the Ruler. The Ruler wishes to talk with you.""

It wasn't quite ""talk""; that was a general word in the Tr'en language, and Didyak had used a specific meaning, roughly: ""gain information from, by peaceful and vocal means."" Korvin filed it away for future reference. ""Why did the Ruler not come to me?"" Korvin asked.

""The Ruler is the Ruler,"" Didyak said, slightly

The relationship between Tr'en's response and Korvin's behavior in the story is that the Tr'en's logical and scientific mindset makes them vulnerable to Korvin's strategy of confusing them with the concept of democracy. Korvin's behavior is driven by his mission to neutralize the threat posed by the Tr'en, and he uses their own strengths against them by presenting them with a seemingly paradoxical concept that they cannot comprehend. This keeps the Tr'en occupied with trying to understand democracy, preventing them from focusing on space exploration and conquest. The Tr'en's response to Korvin's behavior highlights their inability to grasp the idea of a democratic government, which ultimately helps Korvin achieve his mission.

In the input article, the woman referred to is Na, a Martian woman who is Ro's love interest and chosen mate. She is mentioned throughout the story, particularly in the following paragraphs:

- ""He was anxious to see his family again, his father and mother and all his brothers and sisters; to sit round a fire with them at the entrance to their cave and tell of the wondrous places he'd visited. And, most of all, he wanted to see Na, graceful, dark-eyed Na, whose fair face had disturbed his slumber so often, appearing in his dreams to call him home.""
- ""For a long moment Ro studied the approaching creatures. Then he gasped in surprise. The pursued was a young woman, a woman he knew. Na! The pursuer was a squat, ugly rat man, one of the vicious Oan who lived in the cliffs.""
- ""He took a pouch from his waist and shook out a gold arm band. This he clasped on Na's wrist. 'All men will know now that you are the mate of Ro,' he whispered. And he kissed her, as was the custom of his tribe when a man took a wife.""
- ""Na met him at the entrance. She was returning from a clump of trees a short distance away. Her arms were loaded with Manno, the fruit of Mars, and clusters of wild berries and grapes. 'You see,' she said, 'I will make you a good mate. Our table will be well provided for.'""

Additionally, there is another woman mentioned in the story, Charlotte, who is a member of the Earth expedition and Carlson's love interest. She is mentioned in the following paragraphs:

- ""There were two more white ones who came from the sphere. One was a woman with golden hair, and the other, a man of age, with hair like silver frost.""
- ""Ro noticed that Charlotte had slept beside Carlson, but moved away shyly now that it was daylight. He noticed, too, that Grimm was seeing the same thing and seemed annoyed.""
- ""Carlson seemed to come out of a trance. He swung around to trail Ro up the sloping part of the mountain. They climbed in silence.""
- ""Carlson straightened. He weighed Ro's words before answering. Finally he said, 'I didn't want to make trouble. It was a bad time, and senseless, besides. Charlotte and I are planning to be married when we return to America. It's not as though Grimm was still in

The reason behind Ro's behavior of telling the woman not to move is to ensure their safety and the success of their plan. Ro wants to rescue the white men from Earth who have been captured by the Oan and fight the Oan to avenge the death of his father, brothers, and the men of his tribe. By instructing Na and the white men to stay still and not move until he gives a signal with his thoughts, Ro aims to avoid detection by the Oan and execute their plan without any complications.

As a consequence of the white men choosing to sleep in the valley instead of the Martian caves, they were captured by the Oan, a race of rat men. The Oan then used the white men's weapons to attack the Martians, forcing them to leave their caves. This led to a one-sided battle that lasted three days, resulting in the death of many Martians, including Ro's father and two of his brothers.

In the input article, the scientist is Doctor Boynton, who is a tall, elderly man with a small black waxed mustache and Van Dyke. He has a rich, cultivated voice and a nose like a hawk. Doctor Boynton is a member of the Interstellar Cosmography Society, and he, along with two other men, discovers Jonathan Fawkes after his space accident.

The reason behind Jonathan's laughter at the scientist is that Doctor Boynton's comparison of Jonathan's decision to stay on the asteroid to the medieval hermits who fled to the wilderness to escape the temptation of women is ironic and amusing to Jonathan. This is because Jonathan is actually staying on the asteroid due to the presence of the twenty-seven women he has encountered there, which is the complete opposite of what the scientist is suggesting.

The story revolves around the arrival of a stranger from another world, Terra (Earth), who crashes on Venus in a metal globe and interacts with the Venusian characters.

The author does not explicitly liken the Venusian planet to a specific time period in human history. However, the setting and lifestyle depicted in the story, such as the use of clay huts, simple clothing, and primitive tools, suggest a pre-industrial society. The characters' lack of knowledge about other worlds and their amazement at the advanced technology brought by the stranger from Terra also indicate that the Venusian society is less technologically advanced than the Earth society at the time of the story.

He is a business man who also has a strong sense of right and wrong, which leads him to clash with the Thrid and their social system. Jorgenson is particularly disturbed by the treatment of Ganti, a Thrid he had been training to run the trading post. After an incident involving the Grand Panjandrum, Jorgenson finds himself in a difficult situation and ends up being imprisoned on a barren island along with Ganti.


Glen-U is the Grand Panjandrum of Thriddar, the supreme ruler over all the Thrid. He is referred to as the ""Never-Mistaken Glen-U"" and his words are considered unquestionable truth by the Thrid people.


The event involving Jorgenson's business being taken by Glen-U occurs when a high Thrid official visits Jorgenson at the trading post with a scroll containing the words of the Grand Panjandrum, Glen-U. The scroll states that the Rim Stars Trading Corporation desires to present all of its possessions to Glen-U and remit all moneys, goods, and benefactions to him. Jorgenson, outraged by this claim, refuses to comply and even declares Glen-U to be mistaken. This defiance leads to Jorgenson's eventual imprisonment on a barren island, as Glen-U's words cannot be contradicted without severe consequences.

1. Jorgenson was in a bad mood because he woke up thinking of Ganti, who had suffered due to the Thrid's social system and customs.

2. Jorgenson scowled during the ceremonial greetings because he was already in a bad mood and was not happy with the Thrid's customs.

5. Jorgenson swore at the Thrid and turned the shocker-field back on to protect the trading post from any potential threats.

6. Jorgenson reflected sourly on the governors and rulers because they were scared and not imposing, which made him question their authority and the social system of the Thrid.

However, his plan is foiled when Sam Burnett, one of the crew members of the Constellation, kills Kriere and attacks Lethla, leading to his capture.

Lethla, a Venusian official, survives the vacuum of space by wearing a microscopically thin chrysalis made of glassite. This chrysalis is a face-molded mask that is only one-thirtieth of an inch thick and worn only on the head. The glassite mask is transparent and difficult to notice, making it an effective disguise for Lethla and Kriere, the All-Mighty ruler of Venus, to trick Sam Burnett and Rice, the crew of the morgue ship Constellation, into thinking they are dead bodies floating in space. Once Lethla is picked up by the ship's retriever claw and brought inside the ship, he reveals himself to be alive and takes control of the situation with a heat-gun.

It is a rocket that travels through space, picking up the bodies of dead soldiers from various battles and conflicts. The ship is operated by two men, Sam Burnett and Rice, who retrieve the bodies and preserve them on numbered shelves until they can be returned to Earth for burial. The Constellation is described as having a control room with silver levers, audio-plates, and visuals, as well as a star-port with a retriever claw mechanism for collecting bodies from space.

In the input article, the Constellation is mentioned as not having any weapons on board. This is due to the Purple Cross regulations, which prohibit the morgue ship from carrying weapons. The only weapon mentioned in the story is the heat-gun possessed by Lethla, a Venusian enemy official who boards the ship alive and uses it to take control of the Constellation.

The reason behind the Constellation not having weapons is because it is a morgue ship operating under Purple Cross regulations. The ship's primary purpose is to collect the bodies of fallen soldiers from space and transport them back to Earth for burial. As a non-combat vessel, it is required to be weaponless.

He tricks Sam Burnett and Rice into thinking he is dead by wearing a microscopically thin chrysalis of glassite on his face, which allows him to survive in the void of space. Lethla boards the morgue ship, the Constellation, with the intention of using it to rescue Kriere and transport him safely to Venus.

Kriere is the All-Mighty ruler of Venus, who is involved in a war with Earth. He is a significant figure in the story, as capturing him could potentially end the war. Kriere and his right-hand man, Lethla, attempt to use the morgue ship Constellation as a means of safe passage to Venus. However, their plan is foiled by Sam Burnett and Rice, the two crew members of the ship.

In the context of spiders, Lethla and Kriere can be compared in terms of their behavior, abilities, and characteristics. Both Lethla and Kriere exhibit spider-like qualities in their movements and appearances. They are described as delicate and fragile, with Lethla being compared to a fine white spider and Kriere as a white spider delicately dancing on a web of stars. Their movements are also described as graceful and fluid, much like spiders navigating their webs.

In terms of abilities, both Lethla and Kriere demonstrate cunning and resourcefulness, akin to the hunting tactics of spiders. Lethla manages to deceive the crew of the Constellation by pretending to be dead and using a glassite mask to survive in the vacuum of space. Kriere, on the other hand, is the ruler of Venus and is known for his strategic prowess in leading his people through the war. Both characters display the ability to adapt and survive in difficult situations, much like spiders adapting to various environments.

Furthermore, their behavior can be seen as predatory and manipulative, similar to how spiders trap their prey. Lethla takes control of the morgue ship by threatening the crew with a gun, while Kriere is known for his ruthless leadership in the war. Both characters exhibit a cold and calculating demeanor, which can be likened to the patience and precision of spiders when hunting their prey.

In conclusion, Lethla and Kriere can be compared to spiders in terms of their appearances, movements, abilities, and behavior. Both characters display spider-like qualities in their cunning, adaptability, and predatory nature, making them formidable adversaries in the story.

He has been doing this job for ten years and is tired of it, longing for the war to end and for his last trip to be over. He is a tall man with a height of six-foot-one and has a lean, sinewy build. Burnett is experienced and skilled at his job, but he is also emotionally affected by the constant presence of death and the thought of young soldiers losing their lives in the war.

Burnett kills Kriere for several reasons. Firstly, he is tired of his job as a coroner on the morgue ship, collecting dead bodies from space battles for ten years, and he wants this to be his last trip. Secondly, he believes that capturing Kriere, the All-Mighty ruler of Venus, could potentially end the war between Earth and Venus, thus preventing more young soldiers from dying and having to be collected by the morgue ship.

As he lies dying, Burnett reflects on the fact that the cargo is still not full, but he is content knowing that he has potentially saved many lives by capturing Kriere and Lethla. Rice acknowledges Burnett's sacrifice by assigning him the number one hundred, signifying the final spot in the cargo.

1. Burnett's death: The most immediate negative implication is the loss of Burnett's life. He has been working on the morgue ship for ten years and has grown weary of the job, but his sacrifice ultimately costs him his life.

2. Emotional impact on Rice: Burnett's death will likely have a significant emotional impact on Rice, who has been working alongside him and has developed a bond with him. Rice will have to continue his work on the morgue ship without Burnett, which may be difficult for him to cope with.

3. Uncertainty of the war's end: Although capturing Kriere and Lethla is a significant victory, it is not guaranteed that the war will end as a result. There may still be ongoing battles and conflicts that need to be resolved, and the morgue ship may still be needed to collect the bodies of fallen soldiers.

4. Potential retaliation from Venusians: With the capture of their leader, Kriere, and his right-hand man, Lethla, the Venusians may seek revenge against Earth and its forces. This could lead to further escalation of the conflict and more casualties on both sides.

5. Loss of experienced crew member: Burnett's death means the loss of an experienced crew member on the morgue ship. His knowledge and expertise in handling the ship and its operations will be difficult to replace, potentially impacting the efficiency and effectiveness of the ship's future missions.

6. Moral dilemma: The decision to crush Kriere with the claw-like mechanism, while effective in capturing him, may raise moral questions about the use of such brutal tactics in war. This could lead to debates and discussions about the ethics of war and the methods used to achieve victory.

Jorgenson had been training Ganti for this work. However, Ganti's life took a turn for the worse when a local Thrid governor took his wife, leading to her death and Ganti's eventual disappearance. Later, Jorgenson finds Ganti on a barren island, where they both have been imprisoned for contradicting the Grand Panjandrum. Ganti and Jorgenson work together to plan their escape from the island.

In the input article, the governor is a local Thrid official who took Ganti's wife and caused Ganti to attempt to kill him. The governor declared Ganti insane, leading to Ganti's imprisonment on the island. The governor is mentioned in the following paragraphs: 

- ""But the local Thrid governor had spoken and said and observed that Ganti's wife wanted to enter his household. He added that Ganti wanted to yield her to him.""
- ""He'd committed The unthinkable crime—or lunacy—of declaring the Grand Panjandrum mistaken. So by the operation of truth, which was really an anesthetic gas cloud drifted over the trading post, he had vanished from sight.""
- ""You declared the great and Never-Mistaken Glen-U mistaken. This could not be. It proved you either a criminal or insane, because no rational creature could believe him mistaken. He declared you insane, and he cannot be wrong. So soon you will arrive where you are to be confined and no rational being will ever see you face to face.""
- ""But I'm crazy,"" said Ganti calmly. ""I tried to kill the governor who'd taken my wife. So he said I was crazy and that made it true. So I wasn't put in a chained group of laborers. Somebody might have seen me and thought about it. But, sent here, it's worse for me and I'm probably forgotten by now.""

The event involving the governor stealing Ganti's wife occurs when the local Thrid governor speaks and says and observes that Ganti's wife wants to enter his household, and that Ganti wants to yield her to him. Jorgenson, who had been training Ganti to run the trading post, fumes over this situation but cannot do anything about it. Ganti, conditioned to believe that when a governor says he wants to do something, he does, cannot quite grasp the contrary idea. Ganti becomes miserable and mopes, and when his former wife dies of grief, his disbelief in the governor's words becomes positive. Shortly after, Ganti disappears, and Jorgenson is unable to find out what happened to him.

Ganti allows the governor to steal his wife because he has been conditioned to believe that when a governor says he wants to do something, he does. He cannot quite grasp the contrary idea. This is a result of the Thrid's upbringing and education system, which teaches them not to think, not to have any opinion about anything, and only to repeat what nobody questions. They are trained to never make mistakes or differ from officials who cannot make mistakes. As a result, Ganti accepts the situation without questioning it, even though it causes him great distress.

""In the helicopter that feeds us,"" said Jorgenson.

""It never lands,"" said Ganti practically.

""We can make it land,"" said Jorgenson. Thrid weren't allowed to make mistakes; he could make it a mistake not to land.

""The crew is armed,"" said Ganti. ""There are three of them.""

""They've only knives and scimitars,"" said Jorgenson. ""They don't count. We can make better weapons than they have.""

Ganti looked skeptical. Jorgenson explained. He had to demonstrate crudely. The whole idea was novel to Ganti, but the Thrid were smart. Presently he grasped it. He said:

""I see the theory. If we can make it work, all right. But how do we make the copter land?""

Jorgenson realized that they talked oddly. They spoke with leisurely lack of haste, with the lack of hope normal to prisoners to whom escape is impossible, even when they talk about escape. They could have been discussing a matter that would not affect either of them. But Jorgenson quivered inside. He hoped.

""We'll try it,"" said Ganti detachedly, when he'd explained again. ""If it fails, they'll only stop giving us food and water.""

That, of course, did not seem either to him or Jorgenson a reason to hesitate to try what Jorgenson had planned.


Jorgenson is a human character in the story who runs the trading post of the Rim Stars Trading Corporation on the planet Thriddar. He is a business man who also has a strong sense of right and wrong, which leads him to clash with the Thrid and their social system. Jorgenson is particularly disturbed by the treatment of Ganti, a Thrid he had been training to run the trading post. After defying the Grand Panjandrum, Jorgenson finds himself imprisoned on a barren island with Ganti, where they plan their escape.

Ganti is a Thrid character in the story who was once a hopeful candidate to run the trading post without human supervision. Jorgenson had been training Ganti for this work. However, Ganti's life took a turn for the worse when the local Thrid governor took his wife, leading to her eventual death. Ganti tried to kill the governor and was declared insane as a result. He was then sent to a barren island as a prisoner, where he was later joined by Jorgenson. Together, they plan and practice an escape from the island.

Jorgenson is able to speak to Ganti because they are both prisoners on the same isolated island. They have been left there by the Thrid authorities as a punishment for their actions, which were considered mistakes or crimes. As fellow prisoners, they have no choice but to interact with each other and try to find a way to survive and possibly escape their situation.

He is an important figure on Mars, as the person who controls M.B.C. essentially controls the planet. He is described as a big, rough-featured individual with gray leonine hair, and a strong personality. However, he is also shown to be worried and fearful due to the mysterious deaths of his colleagues. Haller contacts Terrestrial Intelligence (T.I.) for help, leading to the arrival of Steve Ranson, the protagonist. Unfortunately, Haller becomes a victim of the mad music, leading to his death in a struggle with Ranson.

Mr. Ranson is a special agent from Terrestrial Intelligence (T.I.) who has been sent to Mars to investigate a mysterious music that has been causing deaths and chaos. He is the protagonist of the story and is determined to find the source of the music and stop it. Throughout the story, he uses his skills and T.I. devices to track down the culprit behind the music, eventually confronting Dr. Elath Taen, a master-scientist and outlaw who wants to exterminate all terrestrials on Mars.

The tragic encounter between Jared Haller and Mr. Ranson occurs when they both hear the mysterious and hypnotic music that has been causing chaos and death in their city. The music affects their minds, driving them into a frenzy of rage and madness. They end up fighting each other, with Haller pulling out a flame-gun and attempting to shoot Ranson. In self-defense, Ranson manages to disarm Haller, but not before the flame-gun goes off, killing Haller in the process. The music then changes to a seductive and irresistible melody, drawing Ranson towards the source of the music and further into danger.

The author's purpose in including the tragic encounter between Jared Haller and Mr. Ranson is to create a dramatic and suspenseful turning point in the story, showcasing the dangerous and powerful effects of the mysterious music on the characters. This encounter serves to heighten the stakes and urgency of Ranson's mission to uncover the source of the music and stop its deadly influence. Additionally, the scene demonstrates the vulnerability of even the most powerful and influential individuals, such as Haller, to the music's hypnotic effects. The tragic outcome of their encounter also serves to further motivate Ranson in his quest to put an end to the chaos and death caused by the music.

This comparison serves to illustrate his suspicion that the lack of proper extraction methods and organization could be contributing to the high number of accidents in the village.

He is a leading business executive on Earth and is described as having a picked-crow physique and scheming financier's wits. Harper suffers from insomnia, stress, and other health issues due to his work and stubbornness. He decides to visit the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars for a rest-cure after hearing about the hotel's robot staff and the potential business opportunity in Martian fungus enzymes. During his stay at the hotel, Harper experiences various issues with the robots and eventually makes a deal to buy out Hagerty's Enzymes and staff the plant with the hotel's robots.

Harper Breen, a leading business executive on Earth, decides to visit the Emerald Star Hotel on Mars for a rest-cure after hearing about the hotel's robot staff and the potential business opportunity in Martian fungus enzymes. Upon arriving at the hotel, Harper is impressed by the efficiency of the robots and considers staffing his offices with them. However, he soon experiences various issues with the robots, including being mistakenly taken for medical treatments he does not need.

During his stay, Harper meets Jake Ellis, a superintendent of a fungus plant on Mars, who complains about not receiving any treatments from the robots. Harper realizes that the hotel clerk had assigned them to the wrong rooms, causing the mix-up with the treatments. They decide to switch rooms, and Harper manages to avoid further treatments from the robots.

Harper confronts the hotel manager about the issues he faced and proposes a deal to buy out Hagerty's Enzymes and staff the plant with the hotel's robots. The manager agrees, and Harper successfully acquires the company and robots at a low price. Despite his initial enthusiasm for using robots as office staff, Harper ultimately decides against it after his experiences at the hotel. He returns to Earth looking healthier and more relaxed, and gifts a block of stock to his brother-in-law, Scribney, who had initially told him about the Martian enzymes.

The reason behind Harper's tone change regarding his vacation to Mars is primarily due to his experience at the Emerald Star Hotel, where he encountered highly efficient robots that inspired him to make a profitable business deal. The relaxation and treatments he received at the hotel, despite his initial resistance, also contributed to his improved health and well-being. This newfound sense of accomplishment and rejuvenation led to a more relaxed, confident, and friendly demeanor, as evidenced by his interactions with Scribney and his overall outlook on life.

They have only thirteen hours left before they need to return to their ship, but they decide to investigate the city. As they approach the city, they notice its alien and malignant appearance, with black walls and strict geometry. They explore the city, trying to find a way out and understand its purpose, while dealing with the mysterious force dome that surrounds it.

In the story, Wass activates the switchboard when he, Martin, and Rodney are trapped in the alien city and trying to find a way out. Despite Martin's warnings against tampering with the switches, Wass decides to take matters into his own hands. He pulls a switch, causing a series of events that ultimately lead to his death. His actions, however, also help Martin and Rodney find a way out of the city through a pipe.

In terms of time, the discovery of the city and Wass activating the switchboard are two significant events that occur at different points in the story. The city's discovery happens at the beginning of the exploration, when Martin and his crew have thirteen hours left before they need to return to their ship. This event sets the stage for the rest of the story, as the crew decides to investigate the city despite the limited time they have.

On the other hand, Wass activating the switchboard occurs later in the story, when the crew is already trapped in the alien city and trying to find a way out. At this point, the time pressure has increased, as they have only a few hours left before their ship leaves. This sense of urgency influences Wass's decision to take matters into his own hands, despite Martin's warnings against tampering with the switches.

The time factor plays a crucial role in both events, as it adds tension and urgency to the story. In the case of the city's discovery, the limited time frame pushes the crew to explore the city quickly and make decisions based on their immediate observations. In the case of Wass activating the switchboard, the dwindling time left before their ship leaves forces the characters to take risks and make desperate choices, ultimately leading to Wass's death but also providing a way out for Martin and Rodney.

One such instance is when Wass taunts Martin about their limited time left before the ship leaves, and Martin switches off his radio, feeling sick after hearing Wass' incoherent babbling and screams as he dies.

The relationship between Martin feeling sick and the escape event is that both instances occur towards the end of the story, as the tension and danger reach their peak. Martin feels sick when he hears Wass' incoherent babbling and screams as he dies, which highlights the sinister nature of the alien city and the urgency of their situation. This feeling of sickness and unease pushes Martin and Rodney to continue their efforts to escape the city. The escape event, where Martin and Rodney find a grate leading to a circular pipe that takes them to the surface, serves as a resolution to the story and a relief from the tension and danger they faced within the alien city.

Dennis is grounded by the I.S.P. due to his recklessness and is given a chance to redeem himself by capturing the space pirate Koerber. He is also in love with Marla Starland, who is captured by Koerber, which further motivates him to pursue the pirate.

Dennis Brooke, a grounded captain of the Interplanetary Space Patrol (I.S.P.), is given a chance to redeem himself by Commander Bertram. Dennis is assigned a mission to capture the notorious space pirate, Bren Koerber, who is responsible for the disappearance of several passenger spacers, including one carrying Dennis' fiancee, Marla Starland. Dennis is provided with a new, fast, and heavily armored I.S.P. cruiser for the mission. He and his crew set out on the dangerous quest, determined to bring Koerber to justice and avenge the loss of Marla and the other passengers.

Dennis Brooke, a thirty-year-old captain of the Interplanetary Space Patrol (I.S.P.), is grounded due to his recklessness. He had failed to capture the space pirate Koerber because he was enjoying the pleasures of a Jovian Chamber in Venus' Interplanetary Palace instead of being on duty. This incident led to a severe rebuff from the I.S.P. and the loss of his love, Marla Starland. However, Dennis is given a chance to redeem himself by capturing Koerber, who has now captured Marla.

The reason behind Dennis being sent on the mission despite being grounded is that Commander Bertram recognizes Dennis as one of the best spacers they have, despite his recklessness. Bertram believes that Dennis' skills and determination make him the right person to capture the notorious space pirate, Bren Koerber. Additionally, Dennis has a personal stake in the mission, as his fiancee, Marla Starland, was on one of the passenger spacers that disappeared due to Koerber's actions. This personal connection further fuels Dennis' motivation to succeed in the mission and redeem himself in the eyes of the I.S.P.

Dennis is a skilled fighter and a respected leader among his crew, despite his past mistakes.


In the input article, Randall is a young and inexperienced crew member of the I.S.P. Cruiser, serving under Captain Dennis Brooke. He is described as having a beardless face and candid blue eyes. During a crucial moment in the battle against Koerber's ship, Randall fails to be at his battle station, causing the crew to be stuck on a desolate planetoid. His actions lead to some of the crew members, such as Dallas, to view him as a coward. However, Captain Brooke defends Randall, acknowledging that he is just a kid and should be given a chance.


The most likely reason behind Dennis's sympathetic behavior towards Randall is that he understands Randall is young and inexperienced, as this is his first trip into the outer orbits. Dennis realizes that better men than Randall have cracked under the pressure in those vast reaches of space, and he believes in giving the young crew member a chance to learn and grow from his mistakes.

The catastrophe caused by Randall's failure in the story occurs when the I.S.P. Cruiser, captained by Dennis Brooke, is engaged in a battle with Koerber's pirate ship. During the battle, Captain Brooke orders Randall to cut all the jets in the rocket room so that they can use the magnetic repulsion plates to avoid being caught in Koerber's magnetic beam. However, Randall fails to follow the order in time due to his paralyzing hysteria, causing the I.S.P. Cruiser to be caught in the magnetic beam and forced to follow Koerber's ship as it plunges towards an unknown planetoid. This results in the I.S.P. Cruiser crash-landing on the desolate planetoid, leaving the crew stranded and their ship damaged.

He has the ability to communicate telepathically and manipulate objects using a green beam. When the four men from Earth arrive on his planet in search of radium, Irgi captures them and attempts to cure them of their growth disease using his knowledge and technology.

Irgi is the last of his monster race, the Urg, and the guardian of a dead planet. The Urg were once a thriving civilization with cities like Bar Nomala, Faryl, and the jungle city of Kreed. However, they have been extinct for hundreds and hundreds of years, leaving Irgi alone in the eon-ancient city. He has preserved the treasures of his people in a vast globe of transparent metal filled with a germ-destroying mist that keeps the city clean and free of dust. The Urg had discovered the secret of immortality through the Chamber of the Cones, which emits a blue light that cleanses and nourishes their life spark. However, this discovery came too late to save the Urg race.

The most likely reason why Irgi was the last of his people is that his race, the Urg, had died out over time. The text mentions that there had been no others for hundreds and hundreds of years, and Irgi had lost count of time dwelling alone amid the marble halls of the eon-ancient city. It is also mentioned that Irgi had discovered the mist and the Chamber of the Cones, which granted him immortality, but these discoveries came too late to save his kind.

Kirk is the main character in the input article, a young man who lives in the Hansquarter with his family, including his mother (Ma Kirk), his sister Lil, and younger siblings. He is strong, with a heavy chest and thick shoulders, and has a deep resentment towards the Officers and Engineers who control the Ship and its resources. Kirk is also a fighter, defending his people against the Piruts during a raid. He is close friends with Jakk Randl, who shares his suspicions about the Officers hoarding resources from the Ship. After his father's death, Kirk becomes more determined to uncover the truth and challenge the Officers.

The reason behind the Officer's careful message delivery to Kirk is to convey the difficult news of his father's death in a sensitive and empathetic manner, while also explaining the necessity of the action taken to protect the entire colony from the Piruts. The Officer understands the emotional impact of the news on Kirk and tries to provide a clear explanation of the situation to help him comprehend the reasons behind the decision. Additionally, the Officer aims to maintain discipline and order within the colony by warning Kirk against spreading dangerous rumors about the Officers and the Ship, and by silencing him when he starts accusing the Officers of hoarding resources and keeping secrets. The Officer's composed demeanor and empathetic tone are crucial in managing the delicate situation and preventing further unrest among the colony members.

The Piruts are a group of raiders who attack the colony where the protagonist, Wes Kirk, and his people live, and they are also interested in the Ship, which is considered sacred and taboo. The Ship, on the other hand, is an ancient and mysterious structure that is believed to hold valuable resources like heat-stones and dried meat, which the Officers are suspected of hoarding for themselves. The Ship is a source of intrigue and tension among the colony's inhabitants, as they are forbidden from accessing it by the Officers. In this context, the Piruts represent an external threat to the colony, while the Ship symbolizes an internal conflict and power struggle among the colony's different social groups.

The intent or purpose of the Piruts in relation to the Ship is to gain control of it for themselves. They believe that there is something holy and valuable within the Ship, and they want to possess it.

Martians are telepaths and have not had a spoken language for several thousand years. They are unpredictable and can be dangerous, as they are armed with spears and some have Benson energy guns, which are forbidden to them. The Martians in the story are descendants of a race that chose to adapt their bodies to the changing conditions on Mars, while another group of Martians sealed themselves into cities like Kal-Jmar.

In the given input article, it is revealed that Martians possess telepathic abilities, which enable them to communicate with one another without the need for spoken language. This form of communication has been in use for several thousand years, as the Martians have adapted to the challenging conditions on their nearly airless planet. Telepathy allows them to exchange thoughts, ideas, and information directly through their minds, bypassing the limitations of spoken language and making it an efficient and effective means of communication in their environment.

The Martians' telepathic abilities have also led to the development of a unique and advanced culture, as they have been able to progress beyond the need for science and technology. This has allowed them to maintain a level of independence from the imperialist Earth culture, which seeks to colonize and exploit Mars for its resources. However, the Martians' telepathic communication has also been used as a means of deception, as they have created a false spoken language to mislead Earthlings and protect their own interests.

Overall, the telepathic communication used by Martians is a highly evolved and sophisticated method that has allowed them to adapt to their harsh planetary conditions and maintain a distinct and advanced culture.

The Engineers are a higher class, living in larger huts and responsible for overseeing the work of the Hans. The Officers are the highest class, living in even larger huts and controlling the entire community. They all live under the shadow of a mysterious Ship, which is believed to hold valuable resources like heat-stones and dried meat. The Ship is guarded by the Officers, and the Hans are forbidden from entering it. The community is constantly under threat from external forces like the Piruts and shags, and they must defend their settlement from these attacks.

In the community discussed in the input article, gender roles seem to be traditional and patriarchal. Men are portrayed as the primary hunters, fighters, and protectors of the community. They are responsible for defending the settlement from external threats like the Piruts and shags. Women, on the other hand, are depicted as caretakers and nurturers, responsible for looking after the children and maintaining the home. For example, Ma Kirk is shown taking care of the baby and managing the household, while her son Wes Kirk and husband go out to hunt and fight. The women in the story are not shown participating in combat or decision-making processes, and their opinions are often dismissed or belittled by the male characters.

He eventually finds himself paralyzed and placed on the coral outcropping offshore, where he is rescued by Gibson.

Stryker is a character in the input article who is the commander of a Terran Colonies expedition. He is described as a veteran with white hair and a paunch, making him look more like a retired cook than a commander. Stryker is responsible for overseeing the crew, which includes Farrell, the navigator, and Gibson, the linguist-ethnologist. He is cautious about following Terran Regulations and is concerned about Gibson's obsession with finding a lost city on the planet Arz.

Arz is an Altarian planet that is being explored by the crew of Marco Four, a Terran Colonies expedition. The planet has a moonless tropical climate and is mostly covered in water with a scattering of small islands covered in bramble. The dominant race on Arz is the octopods, who live in an underwater city and have developed their own culture. They use the pink fishers, a native bipedal species, as bait to hunt flying-lizards in a form of reverse angling. Due to the advanced nature of the octopods' civilization, Arz is not suitable for Terran colonization.

The narrative purpose of having Arthur explore Arz while Stryker slept serves to heighten the suspense and mystery surrounding the Arzians' motivations and the strange ritual involving the flying-lizards and octopods. This exploration allows the protagonist to experience the bizarre ritual firsthand, making the story more engaging and immersive for the reader. Additionally, Arthur's curiosity and determination to uncover the truth drive the plot forward, ultimately leading to Gibson's discovery of the underwater city and the revelation that the octopods are the dominant species on Arz. This twist adds depth to the story and emphasizes the theme of the unknown and the potential dangers of underestimating alien cultures.

They have thick black fur with irregular patches of white, which they can control to expand or contract. They have six limbs, with four legs and two arms, and a unique metabolism that allows them to eat sand and extract oxygen from it. They also consume lichens, fungi, and tumble-grass from the deserts, which are full of deadly poisons. The Martians are telepathic and have not had a spoken language for thousands of years. They are descendants of a race that chose to adapt their bodies to the changing conditions on Mars, as opposed to the inhabitants of Kal-Jmar, who sealed themselves in their city. The Martians are considered unpredictable and are generally avoided by the human characters in the story.


In the input text, the event involving the Martians splitting into two populations is explained by the Martian leader during a conversation with Tate. Several thousand years ago, Mars started losing its atmosphere, and the Martian race had to find a solution to survive. Some Martians chose to seal themselves into cities like Kal-Jmar, while others, the ancestors of the present-day Martians, decided to adapt their bodies to the new conditions. This decision led to the split of the Martian race into two distinct populations. The ones who sealed themselves in cities remained static and eventually died of a plague, while the ones who adapted to the new conditions progressed beyond the need for science.

The splitting of the Martian race into two populations had several significant impacts:

1. The Martians who sealed themselves in cities like Kal-Jmar remained static and did not progress. They relied heavily on science and technology but ultimately died out due to a plague and other causes.

2. The Martians who adapted their bodies to the new conditions evolved and progressed beyond the need for science. They developed telepathic abilities and a unique metabolism that allowed them to survive in the harsh Martian environment.

3. The two populations developed distinct physical and cultural differences, with the present-day Martians having a more canine-like appearance and a unique language that they used to deceive the Earth colonists.

4. The Earth colonists struggled to understand and communicate with the present-day Martians, leading to misconceptions and conflicts between the two races.

5. The Martian leader believes that their ancestors' decision to adapt to the changing environment was the correct one, as it allowed them to progress and survive, while the Martians who sealed themselves in cities ultimately perished.

Martians have a unique metabolism that allows them to breathe like humans in their caverns and also eat sand to obtain oxygen. They are telepathic beings who have not had a spoken language for thousands of years.

The Martians are divided into two groups: the ancient Martians who lived in the sealed city of Kal-Jmar and the present-day Martians who adapted their bodies to the changing conditions on Mars. The present-day Martians are considered more advanced than their ancient counterparts, as they have progressed beyond the need for science. The ancient Martians, on the other hand, chose to seal themselves into cities like Kal-Jmar and remained static in their development. The ancient Martians eventually died out due to a plague and other causes. The present-day Martians have managed to keep their civilization hidden from humans, as they believe that revealing their true nature would not spare them from human imperialism.

In the input article, aspects of human civilization include the colonization of Mars, the establishment of cities like Lillis with protective domes, and the development of advanced technology such as energy pistols, sand cars, and pressure suits for survival in the harsh Martian environment. The humans, represented by characters Syme Rector and Harold Tate, are shown to be curious, adventurous, and driven by personal motives such as escaping the law or uncovering scientific secrets. They also display a sense of imperialism, as the Martians believe that humans would have taken over Mars regardless of whether they thought they were dealing with equals or not. The human civilization is also depicted as having a complex relationship with the native Martians, with misunderstandings and conflicts arising due to differences in language, culture, and values.

In terms of advancement, both Martian and Human civilizations in the input article have their unique strengths and weaknesses. 

Martian civilization has evolved to adapt to the harsh conditions of Mars, developing unique metabolic and telepathic abilities. Their telepathy allows them to communicate without a spoken language, which they have not used for thousands of years. This adaptation to their environment can be considered an advanced trait. Additionally, the present-day Martians have progressed beyond the need for science, which indicates a level of advancement in their understanding of their world. However, their ancient counterparts, who chose to seal themselves in cities like Kal-Jmar, remained static in their development and eventually died out, suggesting a lack of advancement in that aspect of their civilization.

Human civilization, on the other hand, has demonstrated advancement in technology, such as energy pistols, sand cars, and pressure suits, which enable them to survive and explore the Martian environment. They have also established cities like Lillis with protective domes, showcasing their ability to colonize other planets. However, their imperialistic tendencies and inability to understand or appreciate the Martian culture and values indicate a lack of advancement in terms of cultural understanding and empathy.

In conclusion, while Martian civilization has advanced in terms of adaptation to their environment and telepathic communication, human civilization has advanced in technology and colonization efforts. However, both civilizations have areas where they lack advancement, such as the ancient Martians' static development and the humans' imperialistic attitudes and cultural misunderstandings.

In the prestigious British Derby, winning times dropped from 2:55 in 1850 to 2:39 by 1930. This improvement in speed was a result of generations of careful genetic selection and sophisticated training techniques, which ensured that racehorses had every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. However, these speed gains eventually reached a plateau, with the average winning time from 1986 to 1996 remaining at 2:39.


In the input article, Thoroughbreds are mentioned as an example of race horses that have reached a practical limit in terms of speed improvement. Despite generations of careful genetic selection and sophisticated training techniques, race horses have stopped getting faster. One of the limitations mentioned is the weight of their bones, which cannot get any lighter without breaking under stress. The British Derby serves as an example, where winning times dropped significantly from 1850 to 1930 but have remained consistent since 1986, indicating that race horses have reached a practical limit in their speed enhancement.

The main barrier causing stalled speed gains in Thoroughbreds is the biomechanical constraints of their bodies. Racehorses have been specifically bred and reared to run, with generations of careful genetic selection ensuring they possess every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. However, there are limits to how far these characteristics can be pushed. For example, horses can only be bred with ultralight thin bones to a certain point, as the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. This suggests that racehorses may have already reached their natural limits in terms of speed, leading to stalled gains in their performance.

Cruiser to be caught in a magnetic beam and crash-land on a desolate planetoid. His fellow crew members, including Dallas Bernan, express contempt for his cowardice, but Captain Brooke defends him, acknowledging that Randall is just a kid and should be given a chance.


Dennis' ship is an I.S.P. Cruiser, a new design with double hull armored in beryloid, built for maximum speed and power. It is equipped with atom-cannon, magnetic repulsion plates, and jet analyzers. The ship is designed for interplanetary patrol and pursuit of space pirates like Koerber. The cruiser is manned by a crew including Captain Dennis Brooke, Tom Jeffery, Scotty Byrnes, Dallas Bernan, and George Randall.


The planetoid in the input article is an unknown, small world with a diameter of 1200 miles and a composition of minerals and radio-active materials. It has a gravity of seven-eighths of Terra and is located in the dangerous asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. The planetoid has a desolate landscape with towering crags, iridescent soil, and a narrow valley. Its atmosphere is somewhat tenuous but breathable, as long as one does not exert themselves too much. The planetoid is believed to be the legendary core of a world that once existed between Jupiter and Mars.


In the input text, the event involving George Randall's failure to follow orders occurs during a battle between Captain Dennis Brooke's I.S.P. Cruiser and Koerber's pirate ship. As the I.S.P. Cruiser is caught in Koerber's magnetic beam and is being drawn towards a planetoid, Captain Brooke orders Randall to cut all the jets in the rocket room so that they can use the magnetic repulsion plates to escape the gravity trap.

The ship is crewed by four men: Valentine Emerson, Carson Nichols, Karl Mussdorf, and Tilford Gunn. They arrive at the last planet in their course, hoping to find the radium they desperately need. As they land on the planet, they find a dead city covered by a mighty transparent metal globe filled with a mysterious mist. The city appears to be deserted, but they soon encounter Irgi, a tentacled monstrosity and the last of his race. Irgi communicates with them and lifts their ship into the city using a green beam. The crew disembarks from the ship and explores the city, only to be captured by Irgi.

Irgi lived in a city on the planet Urg, which was the last remaining city of his race. The city was eon-ancient and featured marble halls, ebony flooring, and white marble walls hung with golden drapes that never withered. A vast globe of transparent metal covered the city, filled with opalescent mists that bathed the city in shimmering whiteness, destroying dust and germs. The mist was a discovery made by Irgi, which he used to preserve the treasures of his people. The city also contained the Chamber of the Cones, a circular chamber filled with a pale blue luminescence that hummed and throbbed, housing ten tall cones of steelite and a huge block of radiant white matter. The cones and the block possessed all power and were responsible for Irgi's immortality. The city was empty and deserted, with Irgi being the last of his kind.

Thus, the relationship between Emerson's ship and the city where Irgi lived is that the ship's crew arrived at the city in search of radium and encountered Irgi, who brought them into the city using his powers.

He is a skilled diplomat and fighter, able to handle tense situations and negotiate with the alien life forms.


Potter is a character in the input article who is a settler on the planet Adobe. He first encounters Retief when he mistakenly shoots at him, thinking he is a Flap-jack. Potter later introduces Retief to the other settlers and participates in discussions about the ongoing conflict with the Flap-jacks.


Lemuel is a character in the input article who is a tall, broad-faced man in grimy leather. He is a settler on the planet Adobe and is initially suspicious of Retief, accusing him of being a spy. However, Retief quickly proves himself by defeating Lemuel in a physical altercation.


Potter assumes that Retief is Lemuel's cousin because he believes that Retief has come to join the settlers in their fight against the Flap-jacks. This assumption is based on the fact that Retief is from Ivory, and the settlers have been expecting reinforcements from their relatives on Ivory and Verde. Potter's assumption leads him to introduce Retief to the other settlers as Lemuel's cousin, which later causes confusion and conflict when Lemuel denies any relation to Retief.

Retief did not correct Potter's assumption that he was Lemuel's cousin because he wanted to blend in with the settlers and gather information about the situation on Adobe. He knew that correcting Potter might raise suspicions about his true identity and purpose, which could potentially hinder his mission to resolve the conflict between the Terrestrial settlers and the indigenous Jaq. By allowing the settlers to believe he was one of them, Retief was able to gain their trust and learn more about their perspective on the conflict.

The Qornt are a warlike race that vanished around 200 years ago and have now reappeared, occupying the inner planet of the system. They are known for their contempt towards humans and have issued an ultimatum to the Terrestrial Ambassador.

Their faces are characterized by bushy green hair, immense black-lensed goggles covering their staring eyes, and a large bone-white beak.

The Verpp and the Qornt share some physical similarities, such as their tall, bipedal stature, long thin legs with back-bending knees, bushy green hair, and large bone-white beaks. However, there are significant differences between the two species in terms of their characteristics, abilities, and features.

The Verpp, represented by Zubb and Slun, are naturalists and are more peaceful and refined than the Qornt. They are eight feet tall and have immense black-lensed goggles covering their staring eyes. The Verpp can speak Terrestrial with a quaint, archaic accent, which indicates their intelligence and adaptability. They are also more open to interacting with other species, as seen in their willingness to help Retief and Magnan.

On the other hand, the Qornt are a warlike race known for their contempt towards humans and their aggressive behavior. They are sturdily built, standing over ten feet in height, and are part of a drone caste, distinct from the Verpp. The Qornt are argumentative, boastful, and lack appreciation for the finer things in life. They are also known for their love of interplanetary relations and their tendency to issue ultimatums, as seen in their interaction with the Terrestrial Ambassador.

In summary, while the Verpp and the Qornt share some physical similarities, they differ greatly in terms of their characteristics, abilities, and features. The Verpp are more peaceful, refined, and intelligent, while the Qornt are warlike, aggressive, and boastful. These differences in characteristics play a significant role in their interactions with other species, such as humans.

His role is to monitor the seeding process, which aims to prepare Mars' atmosphere for colonization. The entire process is cybernetically controlled and automatic, making Manet's presence seemingly unnecessary. However, he was assigned to the station due to a policy of having one human Overseer for each Seeder station.

4. ans = CONCAT(project_inhabitants, siege_impact) : Combine the project inhabitants and the impact of living under a state of siege to form the final answer","The project inhabitants in the story are portrayed as living in a state of constant fear and paranoia due to the external threats from other projects and the presence of spies. They have become accustomed to their enclosed, self-sufficient lifestyle within the Projects and have lost touch with the outside world. They are generally ignorant about the current state of the world and the radiation levels outside their Project. Their lives are governed by strict rules and regulations, and they rely heavily on technology, such as elevators and ore-sleds, for their daily routines.

Over the course of the story, the project inhabitants are forced to confront the reality of the situation when a supposed spy infiltrates their elevator system. This event serves as a wake-up call for them, making them realize the vulnerability of their Project and the potential dangers that lie within. The protagonist, Edmund Rice, is a prime example of this transformation, as he initially dismisses the idea of venturing outside the Project but later becomes more open to the possibility after interacting with the supposed spy.

In summary, the project inhabitants are initially characterized by their fear, ignorance, and dependence on technology. However, as the story unfolds, they undergo a transformation, becoming more aware of the dangers within their Project and the potential opportunities that lie outside their enclosed world.

The state of siege has a significant impact on the project inhabitants in several ways. Firstly, it creates a constant state of alertness and preparedness among the inhabitants due to the ever-present threat of other projects. This leads to paranoia and anxiety, as they constantly worry about potential attacks and the safety of their resources, such as the ore-sleds.

Secondly, the inhabitants are isolated from the outside world, living in a completely enclosed and self-sufficient project. This isolation affects their worldview and understanding of the world beyond their project, as they have no direct contact with it. This may lead to a lack of empathy and understanding of other people and cultures, as well as a limited perspective on global issues.

Thirdly, the inhabitants are heavily reliant on technology for their daily lives, such as elevators and air conditioning systems. When these systems fail, it causes significant disruption and inconvenience to the inhabitants, highlighting their dependence on technology and the potential vulnerabilities this creates.

Lastly, the presence of a spy within the project highlights the vulnerability of the inhabitants and the potential danger they face from external threats. This further adds to the sense of unease and insecurity among the project inhabitants, as they question the effectiveness of their defenses and the Army's ability to protect them. This may lead to a loss of trust in their own community and government, as well as increased fear and suspicion of outsiders. Overall, living under a state of siege has a profound impact on the project inhabitants' mental well-being, sense of security, and their ability to trust and connect with others.

In the input article, the two men who wanted back into Dreamland are Eddie Horbit and Paulson. Eddie Horbit is a twitchy little man who had been Abraham Lincoln in his Dream and is unable to adjust to reality. He tries to force the Warden to put him back to sleep by threatening him with a gun. Paulson, on the other hand, is a tall, lean man with sad eyes who had been Allen Pinkerton, the detective, in his Dream.

The warden convinces both men that they must work together, with Paulson believing Horbit is the powerful leader he must stop, and Horbit believing Paulson is an agent sent to test him. This plan gives both men a sense of purpose and excitement in the real world, without the need to return to Dreamland.

The machine is used in an attempt to alter the past and change the course of human history for the better.

Albin first interacts with the machine when he unzips his richly embroidered garment and wriggles into the housing of the complex little mechanism. He then picks up the small metal box containing the manuscript, which Bob Skeat had handed to him, and drops it into the gray murk surrounding the time machine. After that, he retrieves a sealed metal cylinder floating near the entrance of the machine and brings it inside. Finally, he materializes the time machine around the green instrument panel and pushes the little red switch from him.

Vivian's playful comment about his ""flashing eyes"" making him irresistible to people adds to his curiosity and fascination with her. Despite feeling skeptical about her comment, Ernie still pulls the brim of his hat down to cover his eyes, possibly because he is self-conscious about this newfound trait and wants to hide it, or because he is playfully taking her advice not to get conceited about it.

In the future, when Ernie sees Vivian next time, he might feel more self-conscious about his ""flashing eyes"" and try to act more confidently around her.

He is the author of ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money"" published in 1936, which introduced Keynesian economics. Keynes challenged the classical macroeconomics theories of his time and proposed a new way of understanding the economy, focusing on the short run and the role of interest rates in determining employment and output levels. His ideas were quickly accepted by many young economists of his time, but the article argues that his legacy has been distorted into a simplistic and crude caricature known as ""vulgar Keynesianism.""

In the input article, Keynes is discussed in the context of his contributions to economics, particularly through his book ""The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money."" The article highlights the following details about Keynes and his ideas:

1. John Maynard Keynes was a subtle and innovative thinker who re-imagined the way the economy worked.
2. Before Keynes, macroeconomics was in a state of arrested development, unable to make sense of the Great Depression.
3. Keynes' ideas focused on the short run, asserting that interest rates were determined by liquidity preference rather than the balance between savings and investment at full employment.
4. If desired savings at full employment exceeded desired investment, the level of employment and output would fall, leading to an economy-wide slump.
5. Keynes' ideas were quickly accepted by the brightest young economists of the time, although some realized that his picture was oversimplified.
6. Early Keynesian models led to paradoxes such as the ""paradox of thrift"" and the ""widow's cruse"" theory of wages and employment.
7. The article argues that the ideas of Keynes have been simplified and turned into a caricature, referred to as ""vulgar Keynesianism,"" which confuses and befogs economic debate to this day.

Keynes' ideas received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time, but over time, his ideas have been simplified and misunderstood, leading to the development of ""vulgar Keynesianism.""

In the input article, the teachings of Keynes can be summarized as follows:

1. Challenging classical macroeconomics: Keynes questioned the classical theories that focused on the long-run tendency of the economy to return to full employment. He argued that in the short run, interest rates were determined by ""liquidity preference"" rather than the balance between savings and investment at full employment.

2. Liquidity preference: According to Keynes, the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets determined interest rates in the short run.

3. Savings and investment: Keynes asserted that if desired savings at full employment exceeded desired investment, the level of employment and output would fall, leading to an economy-wide slump. This was a departure from classical theories that believed interest rates would adjust to equate total savings with total investment.

4. Paradox of thrift: Keynes introduced the idea that an increase in the savings rate could lead to a decline in total savings and investment, as higher desired savings would lead to an economic slump, reducing income and investment demand.

5. Widow's cruse theory: Some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages could raise consumption demand and increase output and employment, as workers were believed to save less than capitalists.

These teachings formed the basis of Keynesian economics, which has since been simplified and misunderstood, leading to the development of ""vulgar Keynesianism.""

2. The prosaic government executive phase (until William Howard Taft) - In this phase, presidents inherited a federal government with more authority and a greater need to use it. As a result, their speeches focused more on the government's policy and less on inspiring the public's behavior.

3. The assertive, theatrical leader-preacher phase (from Theodore Roosevelt onwards) - This phase sees presidents taking on a more assertive and theatrical role, using their speeches to inspire the public and address issues that they believe cannot be managed by the government alone. The language used in these speeches becomes more colloquial, reflecting the change in the size and character of the audience and the means of communication.

The article also highlights the use of memorable words and phrases borrowed from predecessors in these addresses, as well as the treatment of various subjects such as taxes, race relations, and women's issues. It notes that while there is much to be proud of in these speeches, there is also much humility to be learned from the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by past leaders and citizens.

He was a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. He grew up in West Virginia, attended Carnegie Tech and Princeton, and made significant contributions to the field of game theory. Nash also had a tumultuous personal life, including affairs, a marriage, and children. He struggled with mental illness for three decades before experiencing a rare remission and receiving the Nobel Prize.


Nash was a mathematical genius who went through significant transformations and changes throughout his life. In his early years, he was described as a cold and aloof Southerner with a cruel streak, enjoying torturing animals and building homemade bombs. He was also physically attractive, standing at 6 feet 1 inch tall with broad shoulders and a heavily muscled chest.

Nash's brilliance in mathematics led him to solve significant problems in game theory and topology, but his career as a mathematical genius ended after he was expelled from the Rand Corp. due to a lewd act. He was known for his cruel behavior towards his students, colleagues, and his wife, Alicia.

As Nash approached the age of 30, he began showing signs of mental instability, such as an intense interest in the state of Israel, disrobing in public, and believing that aliens were sending him encrypted messages through the New York Times. His big breakdown came when he attempted to solve the Riemann Zeta conjecture, presenting a nonsensical solution to a large audience of mathematicians.

Nash's insanity continued for three decades, with increasingly elaborate delusions, such as believing himself to be various historical and fictional figures. He spent time in both high-end and state mental institutions, and eventually returned to the Princeton area, where he was taken care of by his ex-wife, Alicia.

In the 1990s, Nash's mental state began to improve, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for his work in game theory. This recognition seemed to have a therapeutic effect on him, and he evolved into a ""very fine person,"" according to his ex-wife. The Nobel Prize money helped improve his living situation, and he took on the responsibility of caring for his son, who inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness.

Some of the actions of Nash mentioned in the article include:

1. Torturing animals and building homemade bombs as a boy in West Virginia.
2. Attending Carnegie Tech and later Princeton.
3. Framing and proving the most important proposition in the theory of games within two years of entering Princeton.
4. Being recruited by the Rand Corp.
5. Solving a deep problem in mathematics related to Riemannian manifolds and Euclidean space.
6. Being expelled from Rand after being caught engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room.
7. Teaching at MIT, where he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.
8. Carrying on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to support.
9. Marrying Alicia, a beautiful physics student.
10. Showing an intense interest in the state of Israel.
11. Attempting to solve the Riemann Zeta conjecture, which led to his big breakdown and presentation of mathematical lunacy at Columbia University.
12. Going to Europe to form a world government and attempting to renounce his U.S. citizenship.
13. Spending time in mental asylums and state institutions.
14. Returning to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by his ex-wife Alicia.
15. Haunting the Princeton campus and leaving runic messages on blackboards.
16. Experiencing a remission of his schizophrenia in the 1990s.
17. Receiving the Nobel Prize in economics for his work in game theory.
18. Evolving into a ""very fine person"" according to his ex-wife, humbled by years of psychotic helplessness and buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade.
19. Taking care of his son by Alicia, who inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness.

In the input article, Nash has relations with the following characters or entities:

1. Fellow mathematicians at Princeton and MIT - Nash stood out among them due to his appearance and mathematical genius.
2. Rand Corp. - Nash was recruited by this secretive military think tank but was later expelled as a security risk.
3. MIT undergraduates and graduate students - Nash hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.
4. Several men and a mistress - Nash carried on affairs with them, and the mistress bore him a son he refused to support.
5. Alicia, his wife - Nash married this beautiful physics student, but he was cruel to her, even once throwing her to the ground and putting his foot on her throat.
6. Robert Lowell - Nash spent time with this fellow patient in a mental asylum.
7. Princeton students - They called Nash ""the Phantom"" when he haunted the campus during his years of mental illness.
8. Nobel committee - They debated whether to award Nash the Nobel Prize in economics due to his known madness.
9. King Gustav - Nash interacted with him during the Nobel Prize ceremony.
10. His two sons - One son, born out of wedlock, inherited neither Nash's mathematical promise nor his madness. The other son, born to Alicia, inherited both.
11. Ex-wife Alicia - She took care of Nash during his years of mental illness, even after their divorce.

Examples of high-end beers include Grolsch, Heineken, Pete's Wicked Lager, and Samuel Adams Boston Lager. These beers are typically considered premium and are often preferred by beer enthusiasts for their taste and quality.

2) Mid-Range: Beers in this category are priced at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six-pack. Examples of mid-range beers include Budweiser, Miller Genuine Draft, and Coors Light. These beers are generally mass-produced and are popular among a wide range of consumers due to their affordability and availability.

3) Low: The low-priced beers are priced at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, which is under $3 per six-pack. Examples of low-priced beers include Milwaukee's Best, Schmidt's, and Busch. These beers are often considered budget options and may not be as highly regarded in terms of taste and quality compared to the higher-priced beers.

Deborah Tannen is a professor of linguistics at Georgetown University and the author of several books, including ""That's Not What I Meant!"" (1986), ""You Just Don't Understand"" (1990), ""Talking From 9 to 5"" (1994), and ""The Argument Culture."" She is known for her work in studying male and female conversational patterns and transforming the comparative study of these patterns into a self-help movement. In ""The Argument Culture,"" Tannen discusses the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, and argues that contentious public discourse can poison the political atmosphere and even infect intimate relationships.

In the input article, Tannen seems to have a critical and somewhat negative emotion towards the Bill of Rights, particularly the First Amendment. She views it as a pretext to justify airing views that make for the most entertaining fights, rather than promoting meaningful discourse. She also seems to prefer Asian authoritarianism as an alternative, admiring the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage in ancient China and the group-oriented culture in Japan.

He is responsible for various tasks on the planet, including housework and refuse removal. Zen is also capable of materializing his head and other body parts when needed, such as when he is summoned by the Crown Princess Iximi.

In the input article, the process of Zen becoming divine is not explicitly described. However, we can infer some details from the information provided. Zen had been serving the inhabitants of the planet Uxen for hundreds of centuries. When the idea of divinity was first thrust upon him, he accepted the perquisites of being a god with pleasure. This suggests that Zen might have been a powerful or influential being on the planet, and the inhabitants of Uxen might have started to worship him as a god due to his abilities or qualities.

As Zen continued to serve the people of Uxen, his status as a god became more established, and he eventually became the central figure of the planet's established church. This indicates that over time, the worship of Zen became more organized and institutionalized, further solidifying his divine status.

However, Zen later discovered the drawbacks of being a god, such as having to perform various tasks for the inhabitants of Uxen and dealing with their demands. Despite these challenges, Zen continued to fulfill his divine duties, as he had become an integral part of the planet's culture and religious beliefs.

In summary, while the exact process of Zen becoming divine is not explicitly mentioned in the input article, it can be inferred that his abilities or qualities led the inhabitants of Uxen to worship him as a god, and over time, this worship became more organized and institutionalized, solidifying Zen's divine status.

Swarts is conducting psychological tests on Maitland, claiming that he is interested in finding out why Maitland wants to go to the Moon. He is also capable of time travel and has a background in hunting, having killed a lion with a spear when he was younger.

Swarts' research involves conducting a series of psychological tests on Maitland, a man from the 20th century who harbors a strong desire to go to the Moon. Swarts is particularly interested in understanding the underlying reasons and motivations behind Maitland's ambition. To carry out these tests, Swarts has brought Maitland to the future, where he subjects him to various experimental procedures.

The tests conducted by Swarts include recording Maitland's reactions to different stimuli using specialized instruments. These instruments are designed to measure changes in Maitland's skin potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure, which serve as indicators of his involuntary responses to the stimuli presented. This allows Swarts to gain insights into Maitland's emotional and psychological state during the tests.

In addition to the physiological measurements, Swarts also employs a projector to show Maitland a series of different scenes, with the aim of gauging his emotional reactions to each scenario. This method helps Swarts to further understand Maitland's feelings and thoughts in relation to the various situations presented.

Throughout the entire research process, Swarts maintains a certain level of secrecy and reticence about the true purpose and nature of his experiments.

In the input article, the feedback that controls the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve is based on the Fed's active management of interest rates to maintain a balance between employment and inflation. The Fed pushes interest rates down when it thinks employment is too low and raises them when it thinks the economy is overheating. This visible hand of the Fed aims to achieve its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. The idea is that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy, so they will, on average, have no effect on employment. The Fed, under Greenspan's leadership, has the power to change interest rates freely, as it can double the money supply in a day if needed. This means that the level of employment is normally determined by how high the Fed thinks it can safely go without causing inflation.

The article also discusses the literary style, recurring topics, and the treatment of race relations in these addresses. The author encourages readers to reflect on the values and beliefs of past leaders and citizens, and to recognize that future generations may view our current beliefs with similar amazement and criticism.

The author's stance in the article can be identified as analytical and reflective. The author examines the inaugural addresses of past U.S. presidents, categorizing them into three phases and discussing the changes in style, content, and focus over time. The author also highlights the issues that were prominent in different eras, as well as the gaps and silences in the speeches, particularly regarding race and women. The author expresses a sense of pride in the peaceful transfer of power and the moderation of past presidents, while also acknowledging the ignorance and moral obtuseness of some past beliefs and statements. The author encourages readers to learn from these historical speeches and recognize that future generations will likely view our current beliefs and statements with similar amazement and criticism.

The author discusses the evolution of the style and content of US presidential inaugural addresses, dividing them into three phases: modest classic public servant, prosaic government executive, and assertive leader-preacher. The author notes that the early inaugurals were characterized by modesty, possibly to alleviate concerns about the potential for a monarchy or federal interference in state affairs. The third phase, which began with Woodrow Wilson, saw the inaugural address shift from describing government policy to inspiring public behavior. The author also highlights the change in literary style from classical to colloquial, reflecting the change in audience and means of communication. The article points out that many issues have come and gone in inaugural addresses, but taxes have been a consistent topic. The author also discusses the treatment of race relations in the inaugurals, noting that the subject was largely unmentioned before the Civil War and only reemerged in a weak and abstract form after World War II. The author concludes that there is much to be proud of in the history of inaugural addresses, but also much humility to be learned from the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by past leaders and citizens.

4. ans = CONCAT(recent_speeches, earlier_speeches, comparison) : Combine the recent speeches, earlier speeches, and their comparison to form the final answer","The input article does not specifically mention the most recent speeches that were analyzed. However, it does discuss the general trends and themes found in the inaugural addresses of U.S. presidents from George Washington to Bill Clinton. The article also mentions that the author, Herbert Stein, has analyzed President Clinton's second Inaugural Address in a separate piece.

The article analyzes the inaugural addresses of past U.S. presidents, starting from George Washington in 1789 up to Bill Clinton's first inaugural address in 1993. The author divides the inaugural addresses into three phases: the modest, classic public servant (until Abraham Lincoln); the prosaic government executive (until William Howard Taft); and the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher (from Theodore Roosevelt onwards). The analysis covers various aspects of the speeches, such as their modesty, literary style, and the subjects they address or omit. Some specific inaugural addresses mentioned in the article include those of George Washington, John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, William Henry Harrison, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

When comparing the most recent speeches (up to Bill Clinton's first inaugural address) to the earlier speeches in terms of content, tone, and other relevant aspects, several differences and trends can be observed:

1. Modesty: The earlier speeches, particularly those in the first phase (until Abraham Lincoln), were characterized by a tone of modesty, with presidents emphasizing their limitations and the challenges they faced. In contrast, the more recent speeches, especially those in the third phase (the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher), tend to be more confident and assertive in tone.

2. Literary style: The earlier speeches had a more classical and formal style, with longer sentences and more complex language. The more recent speeches have adopted a more colloquial and accessible style, with shorter sentences and simpler language, reflecting the change in the size and character of the audience and the means of communication.

3. Subjects addressed: The earlier speeches often focused on specific issues of their time, such as territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, and civil-service reform. In contrast, the more recent speeches tend to address broader themes, such as the role of government, the need for national unity, and the importance of individual responsibility. Additionally, some subjects, such as race relations and women's rights, were largely absent from the earlier speeches but have become more prominent in the more recent ones.

4. Inspirational and motivational tone: The more recent speeches, particularly those in the third phase, have adopted a more inspirational and motivational tone, with presidents seeking to inspire the public to take action and contribute to the nation's progress. This is in contrast to the earlier speeches, which were more focused on outlining the government's policy and the president's role as a public servant.

5. Use of rhetorical devices: The more recent speeches tend to make greater use of rhetorical devices, such as repetition and the use of the phrase ""Let us...,"" to create a sense of unity and shared purpose. This is in contrast to the earlier speeches, which were more straightforward and less focused on creating an emotional connection with the audience.

Overall, the more recent speeches can be characterized as more confident, accessible, and inspirational in tone, with a greater focus on broad themes and the role of the individual in contributing to the nation's progress. In contrast, the earlier speeches were more modest, formal, and focused on specific issues of their time.

3. ans = CONCAT(trend_topic, trend_details) : Combine the trend topic and the details to form the final answer","The trend in new stadium construction, as described in the article, is characterized by several key features:

1. Asymmetrical and city-friendly designs: New stadiums, such as Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards, are being built with quirkily asymmetrical and relatively intimate designs that are more integrated into urban neighborhoods.

2. Larger size and more amenities: The new stadiums are larger than their predecessors, with wider concourses, more bathrooms, escalators, food stands, and luxury suites. This increased size, however, often results in upper-deck seats being farther away from the action.

3. Luxury seating: The new stadiums feature a significant increase in luxury seating options, including posh luxury suites and club decks with premium sightlines and services.

4. Public subsidies: Unlike the classic parks, which were mostly privately funded, the new stadiums are heavily subsidized by taxpayers, with team owners contributing little to the construction costs.

5. Urban locations: Many of the new stadiums are being built in downtown or neighborhood locations, which can help to strengthen their cities and generate better patronage.

6. Higher ticket prices: The average admission price for new stadiums tends to be about 35% higher than in older stadiums, partly due to the increased focus on luxury seating options.

Overall, the trend in new stadium construction is towards larger, more luxurious, and more publicly subsidized facilities that attempt to combine traditional character with modern convenience. However, this trend has also led to concerns about the erosion of low-cost seating options, the creation of a caste system among fans, and the potential exploitation of cities by team owners.

In the input article, the trend in new stadium construction is discussed in detail. Some of the key points include:

1. New stadiums are being built to resemble the golden age of ballpark architecture, with quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, and city-friendly designs, such as Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards and its successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver.

2. Despite their claims of intimacy, the new stadiums are actually larger than the classic parks due to added amenities like elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets, bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites.

3. The new stadiums have higher roofs and upper-deck seats farther away from the action, partly due to column placement and luxury seating.

4. The pace of construction is frenzied, with 26 of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupying a park that is less than 10 years old, has been or will be extensively remodeled, or hoping to move into a new one soon.

5. Most of the new stadiums are publicly subsidized, with taxpayers covering most or all of the costs of stadium building.

6. The new parks have fewer cheap seats and more luxury seating, including posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year, club decks, members-only stadium clubs, and on-premises bars and restaurants.

7. The cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million, with some projects like the Yankees' proposed stadium on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carrying a $1 billion price tag.

8. New stadiums can pull cities together when properly designed and sited, with downtown or neighborhood locations where fans can take public transportation or walk to the game, as seen with older parks like Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver.

9. Some teams deliberately seek isolated locations to monopolize parking revenues and game-related business, such as the White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, and Seattle Mariners.

10. The new baseball shrines are a mixed bag, with visually impressive designs and interestingly shaped playing fields, but also large and expensive structures that tend to live on public subsidies and create a caste system among fans.

Additionally, these parks have posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year, club decks with roomier seats and wait staff offering gourmet fare, members-only stadium clubs, and on-premises bars and restaurants. However, some of these new parks have upper-deck seats that are farther away from the game due to column placement and luxury seating tiers.

The direct benefits of the new park designs include:

1. Quirkily asymmetrical playing fields, which provide a visually interesting and unique experience for fans.
2. Relatively intimate steel structures that create a more personal and engaging atmosphere for spectators.
3. City-friendly locations that make the parks more accessible and integrated into the urban environment, potentially boosting local businesses and public transportation usage.
4. Exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings that contribute to an aesthetically pleasing and inviting environment.
5. Modern amenities such as elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets, bathrooms, escalators, and plentiful food stands that improve the overall comfort and convenience for fans.
6. Luxury suites that offer a high-end experience for those willing to pay, generating significant revenue for the teams.
7. Club decks with roomier seats and wait staff offering gourmet fare, providing an upgraded experience for season-ticket holders.
8. Members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants that create exclusive spaces for fans to socialize and enjoy additional amenities.
9. Increased revenue potential for teams through the leasing of luxury suites and club decks, which can help fund player salaries and other team expenses.

However, it should be noted that some of these new parks have upper-deck seats that are farther away from the game due to column placement and luxury seating tiers, which may negatively impact the viewing experience for fans in those sections.

Throughout his career, Said has been both praised and criticized for his work, with critics coming from both traditional scholars and the academic left.

The reasons behind the controversy of Edward W. Said's actions in the input article can be summarized as follows:

1. His involvement in Palestinian affairs has led to accusations and misrepresentations of his character and intentions, with some branding him as ""The Professor of Terror"" or ""Arafat's man in New York."" This has caused controversy as people question his motivations and loyalties.

2. His book Orientalism has been criticized by traditional scholars like Bernard Lewis for its inflammatory tone and questionable knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. This has led to debates about the validity of his arguments and the quality of his scholarship.

3. Left-wing critics like Aijaz Ahmad have accused Said of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline, as well as being too conservative and enamored with the canons of European literature. This has caused controversy as people question whether his work is truly progressive or merely a reflection of his own biases.

4. His works, such as Orientalism and Culture and Imperialism, are seen as uneven in tone, overreaching, and underargued, sometimes causing more controversy than clarity. This has led to debates about the value of his contributions to literary criticism and the study of colonialism.

5. His role as a public intellectual has been questioned due to the tensions between his intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses, which make him a controversial figure. People wonder whether he can effectively balance these different aspects of his life and work, and whether his various roles and interests might compromise his objectivity or integrity.

High End beers were more expensive, ranging from $1.11 to $1.67 per pint, and were expected to have a deeper, richer taste. This group included import lagers from Holland (Grolsch and Heineken) and national-scale ""microbrews"" (Pete's Wicked Lager and Samuel Adams Boston Lager).

Mid-Range beers were moderately priced, at $0.84 per pint, and included popular American brands like Budweiser, Miller Genuine Draft, and Coors Light. These beers were expected to have a decent taste but not as refined as the High End group.

(1986), ""You Just Don't Understand"" (1990), and ""Talking From 9 to 5"" (1994). In these books, she has established herself as a prominent intergender translator and couples counselor, transforming the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. In her book ""The Argument Culture,"" Tannen expands her analysis to address the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, and its impact on human relationships.

In ""The Argument Culture,"" Deborah Tannen criticizes courtroom confrontations, particularly the practice of cross-examination. She argues that the purpose of most cross-examinations is not to establish facts but to discredit the witness, which she sees as inhumane to the victims of cross-examination. Tannen takes issue with the adversarial system, suggesting that it can be cruel and distort the truth. For example, she objects to cross-examination of alleged rape victims, as it can distort events to make a rape appear as consensual sex. She also refers to the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings, arguing that framing the hearings as a two-sided dispute allowed senators to focus on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other evidence.

As an alternative to the American system, Tannen proposes considering the French and German systems. In the French system, judges do most of the questioning, and lawyers cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt is established not by ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" but by the judge's intimate belief or deeply held sense of what happened. Tannen also recalls a Canadian trial where a Holocaust denier's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, which she sees as an example of the cruelty of cross-examination. However, she does not object to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted.

He is a man who has undergone extensive surgery after a serious accident involving a collision between a Moon ship and a Mars liner. As a result of the surgery, Dan's body is a mismatched combination of various body parts from different donors, making him look like an ""involuntary clown."" He is unsure of his identity and struggles to convince his wife, Erica, that he is her husband, Dan Merrol. The story follows Dan as he tries to come to terms with his new appearance and the memories that come with the brain parts he received from the donors.


In the input article, the event where Dan leaves the hospital occurs when he wakes up in a room, feeling alone and wanting to go home. He gets up, reads the chart by his bedside, and searches through the closet for clothes. After dressing himself, he sits down to gain strength and then walks out of the hospital without being stopped by anyone. It is nighttime when he leaves the hospital, and the next thing he remembers is seeing Erica's face as he looks through the door of their home.

In the input article, the doctors let Dan leave the hospital because they believed in Wysocki's theorem, which Dan had invented on the spot. According to the theorem, the patient alone understands what they need, and there are critical times in the recovery of the patient when they should be encouraged to make their own decisions and carry them through by themselves, even though running a slight risk of physical complications. The doctors thought Dan was much stronger than they expected, so when he wanted to go home, they allowed him to do so, following the principles of Wysocki's theorem.

This change in satisfaction can be attributed to the aging baby boomers who are more concerned with their appearance and are influenced by media images of the Great American Smile. People used to be happy if they made it to old age with enough teeth to chew, but the current generation, especially the baby boomers, expect more from their smiles. Dentists have learned to play on this vanity and anxiety, encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but attractive to patients, such as teeth whitening and cosmetic dentistry.

The reasons behind the change in satisfaction with smiles between the current generation and previous generations can be attributed to the following factors:

1. Aging baby boomers: The current generation, especially the baby boomers, are more concerned with their appearance as they age. They want to maintain a youthful and attractive look, which includes having a perfect smile.

2. Influence of media: Media images of the Great American Smile have set high standards for what is considered an attractive smile. This has led to people comparing their own smiles to those they see in advertisements, movies, and television, resulting in dissatisfaction with their own teeth.

3. Increased focus on self-improvement: The current generation is more focused on self-improvement and personal development, which includes taking care of their physical appearance. This has led to a greater emphasis on having a perfect smile as part of their overall image.

4. Advances in dental technology: With the advancements in dental technology, there are now more options available for people to improve their smiles, such as teeth whitening, cosmetic dentistry, and orthodontic treatments. This has made it easier for people to achieve the perfect smile they desire, leading to higher expectations and dissatisfaction with their natural teeth.

5.

As a result, people now have higher expectations for their dental health, including keeping all of their natural teeth. A generation ago, it was considered inevitable that people would lose their teeth around midlife, but now teeth are more resistant to decay and can last a lifetime. Dentists have learned about the importance of treating periodontal disease, which can lead to tooth loss if left untreated. They now encourage patients to take preventive measures such as using rubber tips on their gums, brushing with concentrated fluoride toothpaste, and wearing night guards to control teeth grinding. However, patients often resent these medically advisable treatments and prefer cosmetic dentistry, which offers immediate aesthetic improvements. The success of dentistry has raised expectations so high that patients now view keeping all their teeth as an entitlement and may be resistant to undergoing treatments like gum surgery to preserve their teeth.

He is curious, observant, and persistent in his pursuit of answers. He is also empathetic and understanding towards the Earthwoman and her half-Martian son, showing concern for their well-being and offering help. As the story progresses, the protagonist becomes more determined to find the wanted killer, Harry Smythe, and protect the woman and her son. He is also respectful of Martian customs and traditions, as seen when he visits the Haremheb Reservation during the Festival night.

The woman in the shack is an Earthwoman who married a Martian man named Tahily. She is initially defensive and hostile towards the protagonist, a Mobile Security officer, when he visits her home. She appears to be struggling, with a careworn look and living in a ramshackle house. She is fiercely protective of her half-Martian, half-human son, who can whistle despite Martians being tone-deaf. The woman is determined to find and take revenge on the person who murdered her husband, who she believes was killed because of their inter-species marriage. She is also shown to be emotional and vulnerable, as she breaks down in tears while talking about her husband and their dreams for the future.

The woman's poor treatment of the protagonist stems from several factors. Firstly, she is defensive and hostile towards him because she suspects him of having ulterior motives when he shows up at her home, asking about her son's ability to whistle. She is likely protective of her son and their unique situation, as he is a half-Martian, half-human child, which is unusual and could potentially attract unwanted attention.

Secondly, the woman is emotionally distressed due to her husband's murder and her determination to find and take revenge on the killer. This emotional turmoil likely contributes to her aggressive and confrontational behavior towards the protagonist, as she may see him as a potential threat or obstacle in her quest for vengeance.

Lastly, there is a disagreement between the protagonist and the woman regarding her approach to finding her husband's killer. The protagonist questions the effectiveness of her plan to use her son to gather information from prospectors, suggesting that it is not a sensible or safe strategy. The woman, however, is desperate and determined to avenge her husband's death, and is willing to take risks to achieve her goal. This disagreement further strains their interaction and contributes to the woman's poor treatment of the protagonist.

They have built a pyramid around a Mark III beacon, which is a crucial piece of technology for interstellar navigation. The natives have a primitive culture and religion centered around the beacon, which they believe to be a source of holy water. They have a hierarchical society with priests and shamans, and they use a form of currency made from shells. The protagonist of the story, a repairman, has to interact with these natives in order to fix the malfunctioning beacon.

In the input article, the ""holy waters"" refer to the radioactive water that flows from the base of the pyramid built around the Mark III beacon on a Proxima Centauri planet. The local lizard-like inhabitants consider this water sacred and have built a temple and a city around the pyramid. The water is produced by the reactor-cooling system of the beacon, and its radioactivity causes mutations in the native life-forms that breed true. The priests of the temple serve and guard the sacred fount, and the flow of the holy waters is crucial to their culture and religion.

In the input article, the event involving the holy waters stopping occurs when one of the native lizard priests accidentally throws a switch inside a circuit box while polishing it. This action cuts off the water supply to the Holy Waters, causing the reactor to overheat and the automatic safeties to dump the charge down the pit. As a result, the Holy Waters cease to flow, leading to the old priests being boiled for their negligence and a new group of priests taking over. This event also triggers a series of conflicts and unrest among the native lizard population, who rely on the Holy Waters for their religious practices.

The natives' solution to keeping the holy waters from stopping again was to seal the entrance to the Inner Temple, where the beacon and its controls were located, and keep the protagonist, who claimed to be an emissary sent by their ancestors, inside the temple forever to tend to the Holy Waters. They also decided that the protagonist should be blinded, as per their tradition that only blind priests could enter the Holy of Holies. This way, they believed they could prevent any further tampering with the beacon and ensure the continuous flow of the Holy Waters. However, the protagonist managed to escape their plan and left the door sealed, which should still prevent any further interference with the beacon.

The first event occurs when he realizes that he has arrived home 15 minutes early and has forgotten to buy his daily cigar. He later discovers that the Red Star confectionery, where he usually buys his cigar, has vanished, along with an entire block between Marshall and Grant streets. This disappearance leaves him shaken and confused.

The next day, Mr. Chambers notices that the house across the street appears lopsided and distorted, but it returns to its normal appearance when he focuses on how it should look. Later, he sees a vision of a gigantic, otherworldly city with a colossal face staring down at him, suggesting the presence of another dimension encroaching on his world.

As the story progresses, Mr. Chambers finds that more and more of his surroundings are disappearing. The street outside his house is gone, replaced by a gray emptiness. When he looks out his bedroom window, he sees only the gray void, and when he opens the door to his bedroom and hallway, he finds that they have also vanished.

Throughout these events, Mr. Chambers struggles to understand the connection between the disappearing places and the ideas he presented in his controversial book. He comes to the conclusion that the power of human minds is no longer sufficient to maintain the material world's form, allowing another dimension to take control and reshape reality. As a result, Mr. Chambers is left isolated in his living room, which remains intact due to his strong attachment to it, as the last bastion of his world.

Mr. Chambers is horrified by the thought of places disappearing because it challenges his understanding of reality and the stability of the world he has known for so long. He has lived a secluded life, following a strict routine and focusing on his small, familiar surroundings. The sudden disappearance of familiar places, such as the Red Star confectionery and the changes in his neighbors' houses, makes him question his own sanity and the nature of reality itself. Furthermore, he recalls his own writings about the power of the human mind in shaping the physical world and the possibility of other dimensions and intelligences taking control of matter. The realization that his prophetic words might be coming true, combined with the massive loss of human life due to wars and plagues, adds to his horror and fear of the unknown.

However, Birken is secretive about his past and eventually tries to escape the planet, leading to a confrontation with Kinton and the Tepoktans.

In the input article, George Kinton was hoping for another Terran to arrive on the planet Tepokt, specifically a female Terran. He had been living on the planet for ten years without any contact with his own kind and was excited at the prospect of meeting another human. However, when the new arrival turned out to be a male Terran named Al Birken, Kinton felt a pang of disappointment.

The implication of the survivor, Al Birken, being ""not what he was hoping for"" is that George Kinton's expectations were not met, leading to disappointment and a series of unfortunate events. Kinton had hoped for a female Terran companion who could share his experiences and help him feel more connected to his own kind. Instead, he encountered Birken, a secretive and potentially dangerous individual with a troubled past. This contrast between Kinton's expectations and the reality of Birken's arrival led to conflict, disappointment, and ultimately, Birken's death. The situation highlights the potential consequences of unmet expectations and the challenges of dealing with individuals who do not align with one's hopes or desires.

2. The poor sales, promotion, and dividend reports that he has to present to Torkleson, the union boss.
3. The showdown with Torkleson and the possibility of losing his job.
4. The deteriorating state of the company under the union's control and their focus on quick profits and high dividends.
5. The lack of investment in Research and Development, leading to the loss of important accounts and clients.
6. The threat of being put on the White list, which would prevent him from ever getting a job in management again.
7. The legality and potential repercussions of the management going on strike against the labor union.
8. The possibility of being sent to jail for sabotaging the company's machines and going on strike.
9. The outcome of the board meeting and the potential for violence, as warned by Torkleson.

The relationship between Walter Towne's worries and his work in the input article can be summarized as follows: Walter's work as the Vice President-in-Charge-of-Production of the Robling Titanium Corporation is negatively affected by the union's demands for higher dividends, which forces him to focus on cheap products for quick profit instead of investing in Research and Development. This leads to a decline in sales and the cancellation of big orders. Torkleson, the union boss, blames Walter for the poor performance and threatens to fire him if he doesn't come up with a plan to increase dividends by five percent in the next six months. 

In response, Walter leads a strike of the company's management against the labor union, demanding better management policies and a chance to attend a board meeting. During the strike, Walter and his team sabotage the company's machines, locking them in a feedback loop that renders them useless until the strike demands are met. The strike gains media attention and causes chaos within the company, with workers growing restless and production lines slowing down. 

Eventually, Torkleson agrees to let Walter and his team attend a board meeting, but warns that it may end in a massacre. At the meeting, Walter faces the anger of the ten thousand union members but stands firm in his demands for better management policies and a chance to improve the company's performance.

3. ans = CONCAT(strike_managers, lawyer_need) : Combine the information about the managers on strike and their need for a lawyer to form the final answer","In the story, the managers of the Robling Titanium Corporation decide to go on strike against the labor union that has taken control of the company. The union, led by Daniel P. Torkleson, has been forcing the managers to cut corners and focus on short-term profits, resulting in a decline in the company's overall performance and reputation. The managers, led by Walter Towne, the Vice President-in-Charge-of-Production, are fed up with the union's demands and decide to take drastic action by going on strike.

The managers' strike involves sabotaging the company's machines, locking them into a feedback loop that renders them useless until the proper code is entered. This effectively halts production at the plant, causing panic and unrest among the workers. The managers demand a board meeting with the union to negotiate new contracts that would allow them to manage the company more effectively and focus on long-term growth.

As the strike continues, tensions rise between the union and the striking managers. Torkleson tries to force the managers to return to work by threatening legal action, but the managers stand their ground. Eventually, Torkleson agrees to hold a board meeting, but warns the managers that it will likely end in violence.

At the board meeting, Torkleson tries to rally the workers against the striking managers, accusing them of trying to destroy the company and starve the workers. However, the outcome of the meeting and the fate of the striking managers are left unresolved in the story.

The managers on strike needed a lawyer for several reasons. First, they required legal advice on the unprecedented nature of their strike, as there was no legal precedent for a company's management striking against its own labor. Second, they needed a lawyer to handle injunctions and navigate the legal complexities that would arise during the strike. Third, the lawyer would help them draft and present their contract demands to the union. Finally, the lawyer would represent them in court when they faced charges such as breach of contract, malicious mischief, sabotage of the company's machines, and conspiring to destroy the livelihood of the workers.

As a result, the company's production lines were converted to manufacture titanium-steel trash cans, which quickly saturated the market. This shift in production led to a decline in the company's sales, reputation, and overall performance, ultimately resulting in a conflict between management and labor.

He decides to lead a strike of the management staff against the union-controlled labor force, demanding better management policies and the right to attend a board meeting. Throughout the story, Walter faces various challenges and confrontations with Torkleson and the union, ultimately fighting for the future of the company.

During Walter's trial, he and his lawyer Jeff Bates plead guilty to all the charges against them, including breach of contract, malicious mischief, sabotage of the company's machines, and conspiring to destroy the livelihood of ten thousand workers. The union lawyer is shocked by their plea and tries to withdraw the charges, but Bates objects, insisting that Walter be sent to jail. The case is ultimately thrown out, and the machines continue to sputter.

The reason behind Walter and his lawyer Jeff Bates pleading guilty to all the charges against them during the trial is to put pressure on Torkleson and the union. By pleading guilty, Walter forces the court to either send him to jail or dismiss the case. He knows that Torkleson and the union desperately need him to unlock the machines and get the company back on track. By insisting on going to jail, Walter puts Torkleson in a difficult position, as sending him to jail would not solve the union's problem. This tactic is part of Walter's strategy to gain leverage in negotiations with Torkleson and the union, ultimately aiming to regain control over the management of the company and improve its operations.

The link they seek is a mutual understanding and cooperation that could end the cycle of fear and running away. They attempt to establish this link by using their people's music, which is a powerful and emotional form of communication.

The link discussed in the input article refers to the connection between Ravdin and Dana's people and the Hunters. The two groups were once a common people on a single planet, but they gradually split into separate nations. Ravdin and Dana's people lived in peace, focusing on the growth and beauty of the arts, while the Hunters became increasingly militaristic and hateful. The Hunters began to despise Ravdin and Dana's people for the qualities they themselves had lost, such as peace, love, and happiness. This led to a war between the two groups, followed by centuries of fear and flight for Ravdin and Dana's people, who were constantly hunted by the Hunters.

Ravdin and Dana believe that their people must eventually contact the Hunters and try to forge a link between them, in order to bring their people together again and end the constant hunting and running. They argue that the Hunters might have changed over time, just as their own people have grown and developed.

Joan Hadamard, the social science division chief at CIA, has been following Braun's career as a type study in the evolution of ""the extra-legal ego.""

Despite his initial reluctance, Braun ultimately makes the correct decision, proving the value of his intuition in one-shot gamble situations. This ability is seen as crucial by the CIA, as it could potentially save millions of lives in a real bomb-drop scenario.

These cars are in poor condition, with missing fenders, rusted body panels, broken wheels, and rotted woodwork, making them difficult to sell. Solomon is emotionally attached to these classics and believes they are too good to be cut up for parts. In order to free up space in his yard and preserve the cars, Solomon comes up with a unique method of using engine vacuum and exhaust pressure to launch them into the sky, creating what astronomers call ""Solomon's Orbit.""

Both Solomon and his classics share a sense of being old, worn, and somewhat forgotten. They both have a unique charm and character that sets them apart from the more modern and mainstream items in their respective categories. Additionally, they both struggle to find appreciation and value in the eyes of others, as Solomon's appearance and age may cause people to underestimate him, while the poor condition of the classic cars makes them difficult to sell. Furthermore, they both possess a hidden potential that is only revealed through Solomon's inventive method of launching the cars into the sky, showcasing their resilience and adaptability. In this sense, Solomon and his classics are both underappreciated treasures with a shared history and a connection to a bygone era.

He is also the best driver in Oostpoort and is tasked with driving a groundcar to Rathole, a nearby settlement, to bring a boy named Diego, who is suffering from the Venus Shadow, back to Oostpoort for evacuation to Earth. Jan faces several challenges during his journey, including navigating through rough terrain, earthquakes, and a howling gale.

In the input article, the aircraft mentioned is a flying platform. It is a light-load machine with a ring-shaped base standing on four metal legs. On top of the base, in the center, is a railed circle that can hold two men. Two small gasoline engines sit on each side of the railed circle, and between them on a third side is the fuel tank. The passengers enter it on the fourth side. The platform is powered by twin-ducted fans in their plastic shrouds, which are turned by the engines through heavy rubber belts. The platform was left behind by the American navy when they moved their base, and it requires high octane gasoline to operate.

In the input article, Jan initially tries to use the fuel from his groundcar to power the flying platform. However, this method fails as the platform requires high octane gasoline, while the groundcar uses low-grade diesel fuel. Despite his knowledge and experience with the flying platform, Jan is unable to find an alternative power method to transport Diego in time for the G-boat's blastoff.

The first wave of men rushed onto the stage as Walter stood up. A tomato whizzed past his ear and splattered against the wall. More men clambered onto the stage, shouting and cursing. Walter stood his ground, his face pale but determined.

Suddenly, a voice rang out above the tumult. ""Stop!"" The crowd froze, and all eyes turned to the man who had spoken. It was Bailey, the shop steward. He climbed onto the stage, his face red with anger. ""You fools!"" he shouted. ""Can't you see what's happening? These men are trying to save our company, and you're letting Torkleson destroy it!""

The crowd began to murmur, and some of the men on the stage hesitated. Bailey continued, his voice rising in passion. ""We've been lied to, cheated, and robbed by Torkleson and his cronies. They've taken our company and run it into the ground, all for their own greed. And now they're trying to blame these men for their own failures!""

The crowd's anger began to shift, and they turned their eyes on Torkleson. The union boss tried to speak, but his voice was drowned out by the growing roar of the crowd. The tide had turned, and the workers were no longer willing to be pawns in Torkleson's game.

In the end, the striking managers won their battle. The machines were unlocked, and the company began to rebuild under new leadership. Torkleson and his cronies were ousted, and the workers regained control of their company and their futures. And Walter Towne, the man who had dared to stand up to the powerful union boss, became a symbol of hope and determination for workers everywhere.

The irony in the story lies in the fact that the management, who are traditionally seen as the ones in control and power, are the ones who go on strike against the labor union, which is usually the group that strikes for better working conditions and wages. The roles are reversed, with the labor union now in control of the company and the management struggling to make their voices heard. 

In the end, the management's strike is successful, and they are able to regain some control over the company. This is ironic because strikes are typically associated with labor unions fighting against management, not the other way around. The story highlights the potential consequences of a system where the balance of power is shifted too far in one direction, leading to an unexpected and ironic outcome.

He is desperate for help and believes that Morgan, a writer, can help him by writing about his story and generating public interest.

The impacts of Parks being ordinary in the input article are as follows:

1. Difficulty in convincing people of his extraordinary claim: Due to his ordinary appearance and characteristics, people find it hard to believe that Parks is from another planet in a parallel universe. They dismiss his claims as crazy or laugh at him, making it challenging for him to find help.

2. Rejection from government officials: Parks' ordinary nature leads to government officials, such as the mayor's assistants and the police, not taking him seriously. They refuse to listen to his story or provide any assistance, further isolating him.

3. Inability to find significant differences between his world and Earth: Parks struggles to find any major differences between his world and Earth that could serve as proof of his claims. The similarities in appearance, language, and society make it even more difficult for him to convince others of his true origin.

4. Reliance on a writer for help: Parks turns to Roger Morgan, a writer, for help in spreading his story and gaining public interest. However, Morgan's profession as a science fiction writer makes it even more challenging for Parks to be taken seriously, as people may view his story as just another fictional tale.

Navigators use the signals from multiple beacons to triangulate and determine their position and course in hyperspace, enabling them to travel vast distances across the galaxy. Without the beacons, ships would be unable to navigate through hyperspace, making interstellar travel nearly impossible.

Second, there is an ongoing religious conflict among the natives surrounding the pyramid and the ""holy waters"" that flow from the beacon. This conflict has led to violence and unrest, making the situation even more dangerous for the main character.

Additionally, the native priests are initially suspicious and uncooperative, requiring the main character to use cunning and deception to gain their trust. He does this by disguising himself as a lizard and pretending to be a messenger from their ancestors. However, the priests eventually decide that the main character should be locked inside the beacon forever to tend to the holy waters, forcing him to come up with a creative escape plan. Overall, the main character faces significant challenges in dealing with the locals, but his resourcefulness and adaptability allow him to overcome these obstacles and complete his mission.

In the input article, the main character decides not to use the gun due to the strict regulations and consequences imposed by the company he works for. The company has spy cells on his ship that would report any misconduct, and he is aware that harming native life-forms is prohibited.

He is one of the main characters in the story, participating in the discussions and decision-making processes related to the company's bread products. Tin Philosopher is depicted as a calm, rational, and intelligent machine, often providing insightful comments and suggestions throughout the story.

Tin Philosopher provides a detailed history of bread, highlighting the various advancements in the baking industry. The quest for lighter, whiter bread has been a significant driving force in the evolution of bread-making techniques. The discovery of yeast was a crucial milestone, followed by the process of sifting bran and wheat germ from the flour. Early bleaching and preserving chemicals also played a role in improving the quality of bread.

The vitamin content of wheat germ was a point of contention for some time, but the issue was resolved when tasteless, colorless substitutes were synthesized and introduced into the loaf. This led to the development of bread that was light, airy, and considered the epitome of gustatory excellence.

In the early 21st century, the research of Everett Whitehead, a Puffyloaf chemist, led to the creation of airtight bread that was twenty times stronger (for its weight) than steel and incredibly light. This bread was later exploited by Puffyloaf's competitors, Fairy Bread, with their slogan ""It Makes Ghost Toast.""

The next significant advancement in bread-making was the substitution of purified carbon dioxide, recovered from coal smoke, for the gas generated by yeast organisms. This made the bread-making process more hygienic and efficient. Finally, Puffyloaf introduced the helium-filled loaf, which was lighter and more appealing to consumers. However, this innovation led to the crisis at the center of the story, as the helium-filled loaves began to float away, causing various problems and challenges for the company.

The reason behind Tin Philosopher telling the history of bread in the input article is to provide context and background information on the development of bread-making techniques, leading up to the introduction of the helium-filled loaf by Puffy Products. This history helps to highlight the significance of the new helium loaf and the continuous quest for lighter, whiter bread throughout human history.

He has a reputation for having a strong intuition for one-shot gambles and has a history of involvement in various businesses, including insurance and real estate. He has also backed Broadway plays and sponsored beginning actresses as part of his efforts to become more respectable. In the story, he is called upon by the CIA to use his intuition to determine whether an object dropped in the harbor is a bomb or not.

The big question that Braun faced in the input article was whether the object dropped in the harbor was a bomb or not. The CIA called upon him to use his intuition for one-shot gambles to make this crucial determination, as their usual methods had failed to provide a conclusive answer within the given deadline. The stakes were high, as a wrong guess could potentially result in the loss of millions of lives, including Braun's own family.

Braun, faced with the big question of whether the object dropped in the harbor was a bomb or not, ultimately decided to trust his intuition and declared that it was indeed a bomb. His hunch proved to be correct, as the object was later confirmed to be a bomb, albeit a defused one. This crucial determination showcased the importance of Braun's intuition for one-shot gambles in situations where conventional methods failed to provide a conclusive answer within a given deadline.

Braun's correct answer to the big question showcased the importance of his intuition for one-shot gambles in situations where conventional methods failed to provide a conclusive answer within a given deadline. His determination that the object was indeed a bomb, albeit a defused one, proved that his hunches could be valuable in high-stakes situations. As a result, the CIA recognized the need to have Braun as an active part of their investigation in case of a real bomb-drop in the future, as his intuition might save millions of lives. This realization also led Braun to reconsider his plans of running for Congress, as he acknowledged that his unique abilities might be more important in this context.

If Braun had given a different answer to the big question, several outcomes could have occurred:

1. If he had said that the object was not a bomb, the CIA and Anderton might have continued their investigation and eventually discovered that it was indeed a bomb, albeit a defused one. This would have led to a realization that their methods were not sufficient in identifying the nature of the object in a timely manner, and they would still need to rely on Braun's intuition in future situations.

2. If Braun had refused to answer the question altogether, the CIA and Anderton would have been forced to continue their investigation without his input. This could have led to a longer and more drawn-out process, potentially resulting in the evacuation of the city if they were unable to determine the nature of the object before the deadline.

3. If Braun had given an answer that was completely unrelated to the question, such as suggesting that the object was an alien artifact or a piece of lost treasure, the CIA and Anderton would likely have dismissed his input as unhelpful and continued their investigation without his assistance. This could have led to a similar outcome as in the first scenario, where they eventually discover the true nature of the object but realize that their methods were not sufficient in a timely manner.

In all of these scenarios, the CIA and Anderton would likely still come to the conclusion that their methods were not sufficient for identifying the nature of the object in a timely manner, and that they would need to rely on Braun's intuition in future situations. Additionally, Braun's realization of the importance of his intuition in such high-stakes situations might still lead him to reconsider his plans to run for Congress and instead focus on assisting the CIA in future crises.

Gavir is a native Martian from the Desert Men tribe on Mars. He is tall, with blue skin and hairless, and possesses a strong and agile body. Gavir's connection to Mars is deeply rooted in his upbringing and experiences on the planet. He grew up in a world filled with fear and hatred, where the Martian Development Corporation (MDC) held power over the Martian tribes. Gavir's father was killed by the MDC, pinned to a wall with bayonets through his hands and feet, as a punishment for trying to organize resistance against the Corporation. This event fueled Gavir's desire for vengeance against the head of MDC, who had ordered his father's death. Gavir's life on Mars was marked by constant fear of being seized by MDC guards for labor pools and being sent to work in the mines. He was educated at a mission school, where he learned Earth's language and developed a fascination for Earth's culture and knowledge. Gavir's life took a turn when Dr. Malcomb Rice, a noted anthropologist, discovered him and decided to bring him to Earth.

Gavir, a native Martian, arrives on Earth under the guardianship of Dr. Malcomb Rice, a noted anthropologist. Malcomb had been impressed by Gavir's intelligence and ability to speak Earth's language, which he had learned at a missionary school on Mars. Gavir is brought to Earth to appear on a dreamcast show called ""Dreaming Through the Universe,"" where he shares his thoughts and experiences with millions of Earthmen. During his time on Earth, Gavir becomes a sensation, particularly among the Century-Plussers, who are Earthmen over a hundred years old that have outgrown their Ethical Conditioning. Gavir's fame leads to a contract with the Martian Development Corporation (MDC), which is headed by Jarvis Spurling, the man responsible for the death of Gavir's father. Despite the challenges and dangers he faces, Gavir continues to perform on dreamcasts and becomes a symbol of rebellion and freedom for the Century-Plussers.

The story revolves around the consequences they face when Ronnie's father discovers that both his wife and son can read, which is considered a taboo in their society.

In the input text, the event where Ronnie and Mom were kicked out occurs towards the end of the story. Ronnie's father, David, discovers that Ronnie has been secretly learning to read from Mr. Davis, a man considered an outcast in their society. David is furious and blames his wife, Edith, for instilling a love for old things in Ronnie, which led him to be attracted to books.

The house has windows that are described as friendly eyes of warm golden light, and it is where Ronnie and his mom go to seek refuge after being kicked out of their own home.

The reason Ronnie and Mom went to the Davis house after being kicked out was because Ronnie knew Mr. Davis and his son Kenny, who had taught him how to read.

However, their partnership ends when the protagonist discovers that Henry has been holding out on him, and he decides to team up with Skippy instead.

The relationship between Henry's unhappiness and the arrival of the high-stakes gambler, Chapo, is that Chapo's insistence on not having an audience disrupts Henry's card game setup with the protagonist and Skippy.

Additionally, Henry is concerned about maintaining his reputation and not arousing suspicion among other card players.

He owns an electronic surplus hardware business and is looking for extra cash on the side. He invites other wholesalers in his building to play gin games at his place, where he and the protagonist use a radio receiver and transmitter system to cheat and win money. Henry eventually gets caught holding out on the protagonist, leading to the end of their partnership.

The protagonist in the input article is the narrator, who is a genius card player and uses a radio receiver and transmitter system to cheat in card games. He partners with Henry and later with Skippy, who has the ability to read minds.

In the card game event, the protagonist and his partner, Henry, run a rigged card game setup where they use a radio receiver and transmitter to communicate the cards held by their opponents. The protagonist acts as a stock clerk, moving around the room and observing the opponent's cards, while Henry plays the game. The protagonist sends signals to Henry through the transmitter, which are received as shocks on Henry's skin, allowing him to know the opponent's cards and gain an advantage in the game. They make a steady profit from this setup until a young man named Skippy joins them. Skippy has the ability to read minds, and he helps the protagonist win a big game against a man named Chapo by reading his thoughts from across the street. However, when Henry finds out about Skippy's abilities, he beats Skippy up, causing Skippy to lose his ability to understand the voices he hears in his head.

The event where Henry and the protagonist win in the card game occurs when they use their secret system to cheat and gain an advantage over their opponents. The protagonist uses a small radio transmitter to send signals to Henry, who has two dimes attached to his skin, connected to a radio receiver. As the protagonist observes the opponent's cards, he sends signals to Henry, informing him of the cards held by the opponent. This allows Henry to make better decisions in the game and ultimately win. They manage to win a significant amount of money from their opponents, including a big win of $8,000 from a man named Chapo.

The reason behind Henry and the protagonist being puzzled after winning in the card game is that they had used Skippy's mind-reading ability to know the opponent's cards and win the game. However, they later realized that Skippy had been able to read the cards through a drawn window shade, which seemed impossible. This made them question how Skippy was able to do this and what other abilities he might have, leading to their puzzlement.

He is cunning, resourceful, and opportunistic, always looking for ways to gain an advantage over his opponents. He is also somewhat arrogant, believing himself to be smarter than everyone else, including his partner Henry and the young Skippy. 

Throughout the story, the protagonist's character remains mostly consistent, with his primary motivation being to make money through cheating in card games. However, when he discovers Skippy's mind-reading abilities, he sees an opportunity to expand his operations and make even more money. This leads him to betray his partner Henry and team up with Skippy instead. 

Towards the end of the story, the protagonist's plans are thwarted when Skippy loses his mind-reading abilities after being beaten up by Henry. This leaves the protagonist feeling lonely and somewhat lost, as he is unable to continue his cheating schemes without Skippy's help. Despite this setback, the protagonist remains determined to figure out a way to get Skippy's abilities back and continue their partnership.

In the card game event described in the story, the protagonist and his partner, Henry, run a rigged card game operation. The protagonist uses a small radio receiver and two dimes attached to Henry's skin to send signals about the cards held by their opponents. The protagonist acts as a stock clerk, moving around the room and observing the opponents' cards, then pressing a button on a transmitter to send shocks to Henry, indicating the suits and values of the cards. This system allows Henry to know every card held by the opponent, giving them a steady advantage in the game. However, when a new player named Skippy joins their team, things take an unexpected turn. Skippy reveals that he can hear people's thoughts, which allows him to know the cards held by the opponents without needing the radio receiver system. The protagonist decides to partner with Skippy to exploit his unique ability for their card game operation.

Chapo is a big manufacturer from Chicago who is a card player and likes to play for big stakes. He comes to Henry's place to play a gin game and ends up losing ten thousand dollars to Henry, with the help of the protagonist and Skippy.

The connection between the protagonist's plan and beating Chapo in the card game lies in the fact that the protagonist's plan is centered around cheating in card games to make money. Chapo is a big manufacturer from Chicago who comes to play a high-stakes card game with Henry. The protagonist initially uses his radio receiver and transmitter system to help Henry win against Chapo. However, when Chapo insists on playing without an audience, the protagonist has to improvise and uses Skippy's mind-reading abilities to continue cheating and win the game. Beating Chapo serves as a turning point in the story, as it leads the protagonist to discover Skippy's unique abilities and ultimately betray Henry to partner with Skippy for more lucrative gambling ventures.

The article discusses the history of the Birmingham Maglev, its eventual closure, and the fate of the maglev cars. It also compares the maglev technology with other transportation systems and innovations, such as high-speed rail and Hyperloop.

Victorian era relics refer to the atmospheric railway developed by Henry Pinkus, the Samuda Brothers, and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. This technology used varying air pressure to suck trains up a track in a partial vacuum. Lines were built in London, Dublin, and Brunel's South Devon Railway. The pumping stations from these lines still exist as relics of Victorian visionaries.

The reason for Birmingham building over Victorian era relics is the city's continuous pursuit of progress and modernization. Birmingham is known for promoting new technology and being unsentimental about erasing past versions of the future in its rush to create new ones. The city's motto is 'Forward', and it has a history of replacing older structures and technologies with newer, more advanced ones. This can be seen in the comprehensive 1960s vision of the city, which swept away a century's worth of Victorian architecture and is currently being meticulously taken apart to make way for new developments.

These communities have evolved from early BBSs and the WELL to more recent platforms like blogs, wikis, social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups, podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual communities, social network services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. They are characterized by many-to-many communication, active participation of users, and the ability to form social networks that enable broader, faster, and lower-cost coordination of activities.

These communities have the potential to amplify human sociality, including both positive aspects like altruism, fun, community, and curiosity, as well as negative aspects like gossip, conflict, slander, fraud, greed, and bigotry. The design of social media plays a crucial role in enabling or preventing the development of a healthy public sphere and fostering collective action.

Participatory media literacy is essential for individuals to effectively engage in digital social communities and contribute to a participatory culture. This literacy involves the skills to encode and decode knowledge and power through various forms of media, and when learned, introduces individuals to a community. The more people who know how to use participatory media to learn, inform, persuade, investigate, reveal, advocate, and organize, the more likely the future infosphere will allow, enable, and encourage liberty and participation.

In the input article, the author discusses the emergence of cyberculture studies as an interdisciplinary field involving sociologists, anthropologists, historians, psychologists, economists, programmers, and political scientists. The author highlights the abundance of data available for scientific study due to the nature of online sociality, where much of public behavior is recorded and structured in a way that makes it suitable for systematic study. This rich body of data includes every edit on Wikipedia, discussion and talk pages associated with those edits, and billions of Usenet messages. As patterns begin to emerge from this data, researchers are starting to understand what works and what doesn't work with people online, and why. This knowledge can potentially be used to design better social media systems that support human sociality and encourage beneficial collective action.

In the input article, the relationship between digital social communities and their usefulness for scientific study lies in the abundance of data generated by these communities. As people interact, collaborate, and form connections on various online platforms, they create a wealth of information that can be systematically studied by researchers from various disciplines, such as sociology, anthropology, history, psychology, economics, programming, and political science. This rich body of data, which includes edits on Wikipedia, discussion and talk pages, and billions of Usenet messages, allows researchers to identify patterns and understand what works and what doesn't work with people online, and why. By analyzing this data, researchers can potentially design better social media systems that support human sociality, encourage beneficial collective action, and foster a healthy public sphere. This, in turn, emphasizes the importance of participatory media literacy for individuals to effectively engage in digital social communities and contribute to a participatory culture.

These media are characterized by their social nature, deriving value and power from the active participation of many people, and their ability to link users to each other, forming a public as well as a market. Examples of participatory media include blogs, wikis, RSS, tagging and social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups, podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual communities, social network services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. Participatory media literacy is essential for individuals to effectively engage with and contribute to this new media landscape, fostering a participatory culture that promotes freedom, wealth, and resistance against cultural monopolies and enclosure.

Participatory media include (but aren’t limited to) blogs, wikis, RSS, tagging and social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups, podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual communities, social network services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. These distinctly different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:

1. Many-to-many media now make it possible for every person connected to the network to broadcast as well as receive text, images, audio, video, software, data, discussions, transactions, computations, tags, or links to and from every other person. The asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by the structure of pre-digital technologies has changed radically. This is a technical-structural characteristic.

2. Participatory media are social media whose value and power derives from the active participation of many people. Value derives not just from the size of the audience, but from their power to link to each other, to form a public as well as a market. This is a psychological and social characteristic.

3. Social networks, when amplified by information and communication networks, enable broader, faster, and lower cost coordination of activities. This is an economic and political characteristic.

Blockchain, the technology underlying Bitcoin, allows for the creation of secure, transparent records of transactions, which can be applied to communal decision-making. Platforms like Ethereum, Backfeed, and democracy.earth offer ambitious ideas for networked citizenship and decision-making based on blockchain technology. These systems allow for the rapid formation of associations with clear decision processes, enable members to float proposals and discuss them with peers, and can accommodate various decision rules. The vision of digital democracy is one where power is distributed across non-hierarchical assemblies, each lasting just long enough to enact participants' will before dissolving.

The author argues that there are several barriers to digital democracy. These include a sense of failure in conventional democracy, where people feel that traditional practices no longer express the will of the people and only serve the needs of distant elites. There is also a misunderstanding of the term ""distributed consensus,"" which is often misinterpreted in a political context. The emphasis on property rights and ownership in blockchain technology, which underlies digital democracy proposals, may not align with the values of those advocating for a more democratic system. Additionally, the lack of universal access to technology, such as smartphones or other networked devices, prevents full participation in digital democracy. The complexity of blockchain technology also makes it difficult for most people to understand, making it inherently open to potential abuse. Finally, the values underlying blockchain technology may be incompatible with the principles of the commons, which many proponents of digital democracy support.

The project, spearheaded by the non-governmental Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR) and funded by India's Department of Science and Technology, aims to find out how much carbon is being absorbed by the region's forests. Rai grew up in Delhi and was a tech prodigy before enrolling at Dr. BR Ambedkar University as a master's student. He started working on the project in March 2014.

Kumaon forests are located in the northern Indian foothills of the Himalayas, in the state of Uttarakhand. The area has two main types of oak tree, a number of pines, rhododendrons, cedars, and maples. There are leopards, porcupines, wild boars, a variety of snakes and rodents, and 200 species of butterfly. The forests grow down hillsides into valleys and up along plateaus. The forests of Kumaon are used primarily for fodder and fuel.

Amogh Rai, an ecologist, is collecting data on the forests in Kumaon, a region in the state of Uttarakhand, India, as part of a research project called ""Long-term Monitoring of Biomass Stocks and Forest Community Structures in Temperate Zone of Western Himalaya."" The project, funded by India's Department of Science and Technology and spearheaded by the non-governmental Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR), aims to determine how much carbon is being absorbed by the region's forests. Rai uses various tools, such as a ceptometer, a spherical densiometer, and a laser rangefinder, to measure leaf area index, canopy foliage, and tree height. The data collected will be used to create an allometric equation to understand the basic mechanism of carbon sequestration and the level of human disturbance in these forests. This information will then provide the framework for a plan that seeks to pay local people to maintain the forests and preserve their ability to act as a carbon sink.

This female sensibility in politics is not opposed to reason, but rather complements it by incorporating empathy, compassion, vulnerability, honesty about feelings, generosity of spirit, fidelity to self, and hard thinking. The author suggests that having more women in politics can lead to a more collaborative and emotionally honest political environment, which can help progressives find a new emotional appeal beyond the populists' exploitative deformation of feeling. In this way, the language of women and the human qualities they bring to politics are seen as essential for the future of progressive politics.

According to the author, the most important human quality in the context of politics is the ability to acknowledge and express emotions, such as vulnerability, pain, and empathy. This emotional honesty can lead to a more compassionate and inclusive political environment, where people can connect with each other on a deeper level and work together to find solutions to societal issues. By embracing emotions and caring about issues like love, family, community, and humanity, women's activism can help create a new language of politics that is more in tune with the emotional needs and experiences of people.

1. The evidence from physics, particularly the relationship between arXiv (the OA repository for physics) and toll-access physics journals, which shows that high levels of green OA don't cause journal cancellations.

2. The experience of the Nature Publishing Group, which has found author self-archiving compatible with subscription business models since 2005.

3. The 2006 study from the Publishing Research Consortium (PRC), which asked 400 librarians about the relative weight of different factors in their decisions to cancel subscriptions.

4. The less hypothetical study commissioned by publishers in the same year, which found that the three most important factors used to determine journals for cancellation are faculty requirements, usage, and price.

5. The experience of the American Society for Cell Biology and its journal, Molecular Biology of the Cell, which found that OA after an embargo period increased submissions and subscriptions.

6. The experience of Medknow, which saw its submissions and subscriptions increase when it began offering unembargoed full-text editions of its journals alongside its toll-access print journals.

7. The experience of Hindawi Publishing, which saw its submissions rise steadily after it converted all its peer-reviewed journals to OA in 2007.

In the input article, libraries are mentioned in the following contexts:

1. Libraries wanting to provide immediate access to research articles will still have an incentive to subscribe to toll-access journals, even with green OA policies in place.
2. Libraries wanting to provide access to copyedited published editions of research articles will still have an incentive to subscribe to toll-access journals.
3. Libraries wanting to provide access to other kinds of content published in scholarly journals, such as letters, editorials, review articles, book reviews, announcements, news, conference information, etc., will still have an incentive to subscribe to toll-access journals.
4. Libraries wanting to provide access to all the research articles in a journal, regardless of the sources of funding, will still have an incentive to subscribe to toll-access journals.
5. The Association of College and Research Libraries addressed subscription incentives in a 2004 open letter on the NIH policy, emphasizing that academic libraries will not cancel journal subscriptions as a result of green OA policies.
6. A 2006 study from the Publishing Research Consortium asked 400 librarians about the relative weight of different factors in their decisions to cancel subscriptions. The study found that the three most important factors used to determine journals for cancellation were faculty requirements, usage, and price. Availability of the content via open access (OA) archives and availability via aggregators were ranked equal fourth, but some way behind the first three factors.

In the input article, publication subscriptions are mentioned in the context of toll-access journals and their potential cancellations due to the rise of green Open Access (OA) policies. The article discusses various factors and evidence related to the impact of green OA on journal subscriptions, including the experience in physics, publisher incentives, and the effects of OA mandates. It also highlights that decreased downloads from publishers' websites do not necessarily equate to decreased or canceled subscriptions. Furthermore, the article points out that even if green OA does eventually threaten toll-access journal subscriptions, green OA policies are still justified for the benefit of research.

According to the research in the input article, the three most important factors determining journal cancellations by libraries, in declining order of importance, are: the faculty no longer requiring the journal, usage, and price. Availability of the content via open access (OA) archives and availability via aggregators were ranked equal fourth, but some way behind the first three factors. The journal's impact factor and availability via delayed OA were ranked relatively unimportant. In short, toll-access journals have more to fear from their own price increases than from rising levels of green OA.

Loophole mandates: These mandates provide a moderate level of control to authors. Authors are required to make their work green OA, but if their publisher does not allow it, they can choose not to deposit their work in the repository or not make it OA. This gives authors some flexibility in deciding whether to make their work OA based on their publisher's policies.

2. Deposit mandates: These mandates offer a lower level of control to authors compared to loophole mandates. Authors are required to deposit their work in an OA repository as soon as it is accepted for publication, regardless of their publisher's OA policies. However, the timing of OA depends on the publisher's permission. If the publisher does not allow OA, the deposited article remains dark or non-OA. If the publisher allows OA, the deposit becomes OA as soon as the permission kicks in. In this case, authors have less control over the OA status of their work, as it depends on their publisher's policies.

3. Rights-retention mandates: These mandates provide the highest level of control to authors. Authors are required to deposit their work in an OA repository as soon as it is accepted for publication, and they secure permission for making the deposit OA through rights retention. This ensures that the university or institution already has the needed permission to make the work OA, and authors do not need to take any special steps to retain rights or negotiate with publishers. Additionally, these mandates offer a waiver option, allowing authors to opt out of the grant of permission to the university, though not out of the deposit requirement. This gives authors more control over the OA status of their work, as they can choose to obtain waivers for specific works if they wish.

Doc understands that Joey's ability to move stars with his mind is extraordinary, and he thinks that if Joey can do that, then it should be relatively easier for him to move his own feet and regain his ability to walk. By suggesting this, Doc aims to help Joey focus on a more practical and beneficial goal, which is to regain his mobility and independence. This would not only improve Joey's quality of life but also help him move on from the loss of his dog, Charlie.

As a result of Doc's suggestion, Joey starts focusing on regaining his mobility instead of moving the stars. He practices and eventually learns to wiggle his toes, and then progresses to walking with crutches. Over time, his legs become stronger, and he is able to walk without assistance. Joey goes to school in Sarasota and becomes a normal, active child, playing softball and fishing with other kids.

The world's first commercial maglev system was opened in Birmingham, UK, in 1984, but it was shut down in 1995 due to technical issues and lack of funding. Germany also had a maglev system called the M-Bahn, which operated in West Berlin from 1989-1991 but was dismantled after the Berlin Wall fell. The German conglomerate Transrapid built a 32km test track for their maglev system, but it now stands idle, and their vehicles are up for auction. 

In Asia, however, maglev technology is still being pursued. Japan began maglev testing in 1962 and is currently building the longest, fastest maglev in the world, the Chūō Shinkansen, which will run at 500km/h and connect Tokyo and Nagoya in just 40 minutes. The first link is scheduled to begin operation in 2027. China is also proposing a 600km/h maglev system between Shanghai and Beijing.

The most difficult aspects and challenges faced by maglev lines in the given input article include:

1. High upfront costs: Maglev is more expensive upfront than high-speed rail, making it difficult to justify its implementation in areas with lower passenger traffic.
2. Limited market: There is a gap in the market for maglev, but there is no market in the gap. Mass transit generally needs more capacity rather than super high speed, which maglev provides.
3. Technological complexity: Maglev systems are more complex than traditional high-speed rail systems, making them harder to maintain and operate.
4. Difficulty in obtaining replacement parts: As maglev systems are unique, it can be challenging to find replacement parts when needed, as was the case with the Birmingham Maglev.
5. Competition with other forms of transportation: Maglev lines face competition from other forms of transportation, such as high-speed rail and, more recently, the proposed Hyperloop technology.

The reasons behind the lack of more maglev lines in the world, as mentioned in the article, include:

1. High upfront costs: Maglev systems are more expensive to build and maintain compared to high-speed rail systems. This makes it difficult to justify their implementation, especially in regions with lower passenger traffic.

2. Complexity: Maglev technology is more complex than traditional rail systems, which can make it harder to develop, maintain, and operate.

3. Lower capacity: Maglev systems generally have lower passenger capacity compared to high-speed rail, making them less suitable for mass transit.

4. Insufficient funding: Many maglev projects in the past, such as the British RTV31 hovertrain, were abandoned due to budget cuts and lack of sufficient funding.

5. Market gap: While there is a gap in the market for high-speed maglev systems, there is no significant market demand for them, as most mass transit systems prioritize increased capacity over super high speed.

6. Competition from high-speed rail: High-speed rail systems have proven to be more cost-effective and practical in many cases, making it difficult for maglev technology to compete.

7. Replacement parts and maintenance: In some cases, such as the Birmingham Maglev, replacement parts became difficult to obtain, leading to the eventual shutdown of the system.

In the context of the article, maglevs are discussed as a futuristic and innovative form of transport that was once seen as the future of mass transit. The Birmingham Maglev, which opened in 1984, was the world's first commercial maglev system, connecting Birmingham's airport terminal to the railway station. However, the British maglev never really took off due to various reasons, such as high costs, complexity, and difficulty in obtaining replacement parts. The article also mentions other maglev systems, such as the French Aerotrain, the German Transrapid, and the Japanese Chūō Shinkansen.

In Asia, there is a more serious interest in maglev deployment, particularly in Japan, China, and India. Japan began maglev testing around the same time as Britain in 1962 and is currently building the longest, fastest maglev in the world. The Chūō Shinkansen will run mostly in a tunnel at 500 km/h, taking only 40 minutes to travel the 300 km between Tokyo and Nagoya. This superconducting maglev system uses superconducting coils in the train, which cause repulsion to move the train forward, and wheels for the vehicle to 'land' on the track at low speeds. The first link between Tokyo and Nagoya is scheduled to begin operation in 2027. Additionally, China is proposing a 600 km/h maglev system between Shanghai and Beijing.

By understanding the basic mechanism of carbon sequestration and the level of human disturbance in these forests, the project can provide the framework for a plan that seeks to pay local people to maintain the forests. If the project can determine how much human interaction with the forest has affected the trees' ability to photosynthesize, then local people can be paid to preserve the forest. The idea is to create something fairly simple that can be executed neatly across a spectrum. A paper will be submitted to the Department of Science and Technology and then a conversation about incentive structures for the local community will begin, using the carbon sequestration data as a basis for what should be offered. There are fears about corruption; and the dispersal of money remains a sketchy and murky affair but, as Rai says, ""the idea is that you at least need to get this thing started. If you don't pay people enough to maintain the forest, give me two reasons why they should keep the forests as they are, so that you or I could come and enjoy them? Because they are the ones who have to face the winters here, they are the ones who have to go and work in the forests here."" Consultations are ongoing with villagers, various NGOs and the forest department. Once upon a time, the strong social system – the ecologically minded functioning of the rural villages extolled by Gandhi – and dependence on the forest meant the environment was preserved. Now, these things are changing fairly rapidly. The whole idea of working as a social group is getting lost and so, Rai argues, ""incentives are going to play a larger role. I've had conversations with people where they've said, 'The forests are great, we want to protect them but we don't have any money.' So it's not just about giving them an incentive to protect the forest, it's that they need money to protect the forest."" With the data now collected, allometric equations will determine how much carbon is sequestered in the forests. This information will then be used to put an economic value on the various plots, which will translate into payments made to local communities through the forest councils. This money could begin to pour in within the year.

The Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR) is working on a project to determine how much carbon is being absorbed by the forests in the Himalayan foothills of India. The project aims to understand the basic mechanism of carbon sequestration and the level of human disturbance in these forests, in order to provide a framework for a plan that seeks to pay local people to maintain the forests. If the project can determine how much human interaction with the forest has affected the trees' ability to photosynthesize, then local people can be paid to preserve the forest. Otherwise, its ability to act as a 'carbon sink' (anything that absorbs more carbon than it releases) risks damage from overuse. The challenge for this project mirrors the challenge faced by climate change scientists and policymakers across the world: how can you reduce fossil fuel emissions and maintain and improve carbon sinks without disrupting or destroying the lives of local people, many of whom will be those most affected by climate change?

The irony between the money locals receive and the preservation of the forest in the input article lies in the fact that while the project aims to pay local people to maintain the forests, this monetary incentive may actually weaken their ties to the forest and reduce their desire to preserve it. The project is based on the idea that if local people are paid to preserve the forest, they will be more likely to do so. However, as the article points out, using the forest less may actually weaken the local people's connection to it, making the desire to preserve it less urgent. This creates a dilemma where the monetization of forest maintenance, which is intended to help preserve the forest, may actually have the opposite effect by reducing the local people's attachment to the forest and their motivation to protect it.

In the given quote, The Lancet, an Elsevier journal, expresses disagreement with Patricia Schroeder, the President of the Association of American Publishers, regarding her claim that increasing access to research through green open access (OA) mandates would cause the collapse of scientific publishing. The editorial argues that Schroeder's claim lacks evidence and is based solely on her assertion of the threat.

There are three approaches to strong OA policies at universities: 

1. Loophole mandates: These require green OA (Open Access through repositories) except when the author's publisher doesn't allow it. 
2. Deposit mandates: These require deposit in an OA repository as soon as the article is accepted for publication, but they separate the timing of deposit from the timing of OA. If the author's publisher doesn't allow OA, then these policies keep the deposited article dark or non-OA. 
3. Rights-retention mandates: These require deposit in an OA repository as soon as the article is accepted for publication, just like deposit mandates. But they add a method to secure permission for making the deposit OA. There's more than one way to secure that permission, such as retaining the nonexclusive right to authorize OA through a repository.

It is important to note that none of these mandates absolutely require OA, as they all have some level of flexibility, such as allowing some work to escape through the loophole, allowing some deposited work to remain dark, or offering waiver options for authors.

1. Faculty voting for a rights-retention OA mandate with a waiver option: Faculty votes tend to be overwhelming or unanimous when a waiver option is available in a rights-retention OA mandate.
2. Institutions adopting the strongest OA policies they can: Institutions should adopt the strongest OA policies they can today and watch for the moment when they could strengthen them.
3. Institutions seizing opportunities to strengthen their OA policies: Institutions should watch the shifting balance of power and seize opportunities to strengthen their OA policies as circumstances change.
