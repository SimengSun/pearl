His mother is mentioned briefly when Ro recalls her warning about the Oan, the rat men who inhabit the cliffs: ""The rat men have eyes to cut the night."" This memory of his mother's voice indicates that she played a role in teaching Ro about the dangers of their world and how to survive in it. The relationship between Ro and his mother seems to be one of a caring and protective parent who imparts wisdom and knowledge to her child.

There is only one mention of Ro's mother in the story, and it is not a direct event but rather a memory that Ro recalls. Ro remembers his mother's warning about the Oan, saying, ""The rat men have eyes to cut the night."" This memory serves as a reminder for Ro to be cautious and vigilant while navigating the dangerous terrain and dealing with the Oan.
